foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Each year more than 3 million pilgrims go to Lourdes. Since 1858, physicians recorded 7000 unexplained healings, the Church recognized 70 miracles. My Lord... You know I ran away from home at fourteen. I was still only a child. You know how much I suffered. Protect me. Make me change my life. Give me a better life. I am a man. I am a woman. I'm not sure anymore. I'm a bit lost. Enlighten me, my Lord. Don't ever abandon me. It's bedtime. Here's the cap. The water from Lourdes goes inside. Next, young man... These are the train tickets for Daddy, along with your disability card. It's for Daddy. Right. And your medicine. Do you know what this medicine is for? It's for your thyroid. Now, we close this. Daddy will put his clothes in too. Ready? In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. My Lord, Jean-Baptiste and Patrick are going to Lourdes to ask for a miracle for Augustin. He's in palliative care at home. Please put an end to his suffering. And if his painkillers stop being effective, please give us the strength to be by his side until the very end. And, if Augustin is still of this world, please allow us, Blessed Virgin, to keep him with us until next year. That would mean a lot. Amen. Hungry? - A little. - Just a little? There you go. Let's put the plate on top. That's good. I made some nice vegetables. I'll put an egg on top. And goat's cheese? I'll add some, if you want. You remember, tomorrow morning? We have to get up at 6 o'clock. I'm going to see the Virgin. That's why you need a good night's sleep. I'll see my girlfriends. The big day is here. You can eat with your fingers, one at a time. Don't choke on them. Bad timing. I'll watch my favorite soap soon. That's right. Because it's 8.10 pm now. - My teeth need to be brushed. - I'll brush them. I'll go play in my room, and watch TV at the same time. Yes! Catholic Church "Mary looked at me as a person” Don't worry, I've got you. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Slowly... That's it. The windows were open. The April weather was nice. We saw the ambulance drive by. So we kept looking out the window. There had been an accident. There was a knock on the door. We were told that Cedric had been in an accident. "No, Cedric is here," I said. I called for him, and suddenly it hit me. I knew it was for real. They were caring for him. They wouldn't let me into the ambulance. I kept throwing up. I knew it was serious. Very serious. He had been thrown 150 feet from the road, and landed on his head and his left side. Check your watch. We're almost there. And then, we'll clean up your hand. My husband was incredible, too. It was hard in the beginning. He was our son, but... We both blamed each other. Neither one of us saw Cedric go out. We still regret that. You have to live with your guilt. Is it coming out? You sure? He just turned forty, you know. And I care for him like a child. He'll always be my baby. Pilgrimage train, track B... Jean-Baptiste, look at my hand. Have a safe trip. Who do we pray to? Jesus, Mary and Bernadette. You think of us. We'll be thinking of you. We each have our rosary. Where is yours? Show me. There it is. Thank you. You pull the stretcher, once we've lifted him. We lift him, Jean-Marie pulls it away. We keep holding him up. Okay. Wait, I'll pick him up from here. Perfect. Are you happy to be here? We're here. We're in Lourdes! Time to get off the bus. You want to grab me, don't you? I'm coming, Sylvie. She wants to get off. It's okay, Sylvie. We're getting off. We're here. Good trip? - Yes, Father. - Wonderful. Patricia, how are you? I hope the trip wasn't too long. Not at all. Let's go. Table 14. I know where it is. Fantastic! Hello, Sylvie. We're over here. I think she's here too. How are you, Sylvie? How was the trip? Tiring? Hello there. Table 12 for you. Over here. Table 12 is a round table. My Lord, we offer this food up to you May it multiply and feed the hungry So together, we may sing your praise Bon appetit! When were you in Jerusalem? Two years ago? Six years ago? Jesus, time flies! You've been coming here for 15 years. What has it done for you? "NO..." Hang on a second... Show me again. "It's been nice"? Is that right? "Not N-I..." "Not N-U..." "Not much"? That's terrible! "Not much", after 15 years? Does your faith make your life easier? N-O. No. Does it change your life? No... Really? Does it bring you anything at all? "Obscure"? "Of course"! Don't go speaking English on me! I'll never understand. Come on, don't cry. - You want to talk to Mommy? - Yes. Okay, we'll call Mommy. Look, Mommy. Jean-Baptiste is sad. My baby is sad. What's wrong, honey? There's Augustin. Hi, Augustin. Augustin couldn't go to Lourdes. Unbelievable. He's playing with the rosary. With the rosary and the little bell. That's wonderful. Augustin suffered less last night. He slept well. His finger is better. But it's still painful, obviously. His eyes were borderline yesterday. But we avoided the worst. But he's as perky as ever. He was in pain so he slept with your teddy. I had to give him extra morphine. I gave him your teddy, because you took his to Lourdes, and he hugged your teddy tight. Very good. May I have an apron and three pairs of gloves? Here's the apron. How do you wash them? Just like you would wash yourself. You start with the head and the "clean" areas. And you move on to the dirtier parts. It's not easy for you, nor for them. They don't know you. They're accustomed to home, or to a facility where they have "their" nurses. We just show up, ready to wash them. So, it's not easy for either of you. We do our best to keep infirm pilgrims as comfortable as possible, in their bubble. And not bare-assed. With people coming and going, it's not nice to be naked. Incontinence pants must be changed as many times as necessary. At least, in the morning, after lunch, and around dinner. Before bedtime. And during the night, if needed. With a washcloth and some soap, you wipe them down. Watch out for the folds in the groin area. Dry them well and dress them again. Pamper them. Put cream on them. Spray them with perfume, shave them. Clean their eyeglasses and brush their teeth. Do their hair. Make them look nice for the Holy Virgin! They need respect. Special care, even once a year, goes a long way. By the Eucharist we have received, please grant us, O Lord, that by imitating the charity of St. Francis, and the generosity of his apostle's heart, we put to use, for the salvation of all, the graces that your love has brought us by Jesus Christ, our Lord. May God Almighty be merciful. May He forgive our sins and lead us unto eternal life. At 48, I began to limp. I found out I had Lou Gehrig's disease, which is incurable. It's a disease that slowly buries you alive. Your muscles stop working, one by one. Paralysis ultimately sets in, complete paralysis. There is absolutely no hope. Your world falls apart. The day I was diagnosed, I was in shock. I could clearly see the terrifying future that awaited me. I was most likely going to die relatively soon. I had a couple of years at most. My head began to spin as I discovered what laid ahead. But this only lasted ten minutes. An astonishing inner peace came over me, and has never left me. I've never once felt abandoned. That's what has kept me going, day after day, and helped me not live in fear. What's really hard is looking at someone across from you, who has to tell you you're dying. Something fundamental inside you is shattered in that moment. You realize your number is up. That's when I decided to live. I am increasingly limited in what I can do. Now, walking seems as impossible as flying would be, to a healthy person. You have to go slowly. I'm dizzy. That's normal. Your body needs to wake up. You can't always tell, but that's how it is. I make people laugh and I'm always smiling. That's good. Keep smiling. I've always been this way. It's hard on my own. It's okay to need help, you know. You let me know. I'm afraid to hurt you, actually. But it'll be better by this evening or tomorrow morning. We just need to get to know each other. Now, this will be good for you. There's nothing worse than having water trapped under your breasts. It's really unpleasant. Okay, let's go. Francis, cut it out. Sit down. Okay, put him down. That's good. Okay, Francis. That's it. Let go of me, Francis. - Let go. - Enough! Time to shower. Be good or no shower. Put your feet here. You want me to lift you up? Slowly. Try not to hurt me. Be gentle. One, two, three... Let's go. Are you okay? Turn around. Come on, Francis. Come on... That's it. Keep turning. Just a little more. There you go. Can you sit? Very good. We did it. You were a roofer? I fell from a roof. You fell 20 feet off a roof... Onto your back. This is cool. It sure is. Early in the morning... Just us guys. We are gathered here, in the very heart of the sanctuaries of Lourdes. In front of the grotto where, for the first time, on February 11, 1858, the Virgin Mary appeared before young Bernadette. How difficult it is to turn our eyes away from this rock that is exactly as it was at the time of the apparitions. Daddy? For Augustin. I'll hold you up. Let's go, son. Let's say a little prayer. Reach out and touch the rock. Go on, touch it. Is it this one? Touch the rock. Please, Blessed Virgin, make Grandma better. Grandma and Grandpa. Grandpa, too. Please relieve his suffering. Don't let him suffer. Ask her to take care of you and your family. Yeah. - Go on, say it. - Mother Blessed Virgin. O compassionate Virgin O omnipotent Queen O mother of infinite goodness From the darkness Bring us into the light And from death Lead us unto immortality O mother of infinite goodness I used to believe in miracles. But soon I realized... I prayed hard, really hard, that he might at least stand up. That would have been a good thing. I've never been angry at the Virgin. It's not her fault, poor dear. If she could have helped, she would have. But there are so many people in need of something. There are too many of us, just like the lottery. So few of us get picked. That's the problem. Really. There aren't that many miracles, if you think about it. I finally understood that this was meant to be. This was my purpose on Earth. My job was to care for my son. No, I told you I'd give it to you. Here's the cookie. He's eight. It's not easy for him. He'll always be small. We refused growth hormones. Unfortunately, his brother Augustin is very sick as well. He has epidermolysis bullosa. Sores all over his body. Average life-expectancy is two years. And he's two. Blessed Virgin Mary, please protect my life's treasures. Give me the strength to face the afflictions of my two children, Jean-Baptiste and Augustin. Please give Laetitia the courage she'll need to relieve Augustin's pain, that persists despite the morphine. I beg you to soothe, every day and every night, my little Augustin's burns and sores. I thank you for giving us these additional moments of our humble existence with Augustin, whose days are numbered. Blessed Virgin Mary, help us to accept that he will leave us. Please take him into your protective arms. Wait... Careful. Here. - Ready? - Okay. Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. After the accident, I kept having the same dream. I'm running after my son, crying. But I can't catch him. He is too fast. I call out to him, but he just keeps running faster. He runs into a tunnel. He keeps running in the tunnel, and I can't catch him. I dreamed this almost every night. Every night... I'm accompanying a special group of people. They're all prostitutes in Paris. Each year, we bring them here on a pilgrimage. It's very moving. Excuse me? Pleased to meet you, Father. I'm with the Magdalena group. People who prostitute themselves in Paris. A man in our group would like to be an altar boy. It means a lot to him. He's very devout. Can I call him over? Thank you. You can leave your jacket there. A nun is bringing you a robe. Don't worry if you make a mistake. The key is to stay calm, even if you mess up. - Ready? - Let's go. This is the wine. This is the water. Blessed are You, Lord, God of all creation. Through your goodness, we have this bread which Earth has given and human hands have made. Thank you, Father. Have a good day. Several girls stopped turning tricks because of the grotto. After praying here, they knew they had to stop. The Lord says, "I don't judge, but I'd like you to stop." Four... Six... Eight... Ten. Are you okay, honey? You seem tired. You should be happy. You saw the grotto on the first day. I worry when she is too calm. I should be used to it. We've been healing her for 14 years. When we leave here, she's outbreak-free for three to four months. As a baby, she was diagnosed with a rare disease. She had 70 cysts in her left arm. She's already had two embolizations. Her arm is swollen again, so it may have come back. Three years ago, we combed the real estate agencies. She wanted us to move to Lourdes. This one's nice. How much is it? Where are the magnets? You know the store. Which one for Mom? We're not buying everything today, you know. What's important is a jug, SO you can bathe. - Would you like a bag? - Yes, please. She washes herself with the water whenever we visit. - So, I always buy a jug. - I see. Holy Mary, I've come here to confide in you. I get harassed at school. People say horrible things to me. I really want it to stop. Don't cry, honey. The Holy Virgin will help you. Our Lady, you know what she's endured. The verbal attacks and insults on the internet. We are putting all our faith in you for the upcoming school year. She really needs your help. I must say, I prayed a lot. To find myself, at 95, in this state... I think you should be proud of yourself. Your mind is still very sharp. We have good conversations. You're quite a fighter, you know. How not to lose one's mind Held tight in courageous arms We still believe in sweet words of love When they're spoken with the eyes I, who loved him so He was the handsomest man in St. Jean I was dazzled, captivated by his kiss We never sit down during meals. Except those of us who feed. This is delicious. Compliments to the chef. I'm in literary studies. Shit... So I have lots of philosophy. I also have history and foreign languages. What do I want to be? Sorry, I'm only 14. I don't know yet. He wants to eat. My dad wants me to study physics and be a journalist. But speaking well is important. So I study literature. Science is always useful. Lots of journalists have scientific backgrounds. Well, I'm sticking with literature. You know how I eat yogurt? A spoonful of yogurt, a spoonful of sugar. Yogurt, sugar... That's too much for me. I'm addicted to sugar. Totally addicted. "It is said that exegesis is the art of asking the right questions. "Second conviction: an author always has an objective. Each text is written with a specific audience and goal in mind." Can you go like this? In fact, I never put the sugar away... It stays out. I used to be fond of rock candy, the yellow kind. - Brown sugar? - Yes, brown. Cane sugar. - I don't like that. - Well, I do. You learn to read "yes" and "no". This is "yes", and this is "no". Go ahead, show us "yes". And "no". It's pretty simple. Letters are more complicated. Jean-Louis is fond of long sentences. The things he's able to write... I've known him for 15 years. We met on his first trip to Lourdes. Jean-Louis... lived a great love story. But it didn't end well. He tried to kill himself twice. Unfortunately, now he's like this. He decided to visit Lourdes because he felt that his only hope was his faith. Today, I see death as a door to an unknown world. But a world, nonetheless. I've never been in such a weakened state in my life. So I am learning to put my faith in someone greater and stronger than myself: the Virgin Mary. I am learning to let myself go. Through this holy anointing, may the Lord, in his love and mercy help you, Jean, with the grace of the Holy Spirit. May the Lord who frees you from sin save you and raise you up. May He bring peace and the joy of the Holy Spirit to your heart. May He unite you with the suffering Christ, and bring you the joy of being Christian throughout your life. VIOLIN FOR SALE WEDDING DRESS FOR SALE Mass tonight at 6.00 pm in the big tent. Followed by a youth vigil at 9.30 pm. It's not easy. People look down at us. They're rude when we ring their bell. Some won't let us park. We're chased out of town. "You can't park here! It's illegal.” Sometimes, we don't have time to go to work. But here at Lourdes, I feel Mary comforting us. Like a mother with her children. That's what I come here for. To be consoled by the Blessed Virgin. I think of the motherless ones. The first time I came here, my mother was with me. I was just a child. That was fifty years ago. Fifty-four, in fact. All these images flash before your eyes. And you feel close to your mother. The mother of all. Mother is here, right here in front of me. You're right. As soon as I get here I feel... relieved. Earlier, I thought to myself, "I feel so tired. "At peace, but exhausted. I want to sleep. That's how good I feel." That's how it feels in Mother's arms. All men need a mother, to move ahead. Mary becomes our mother. When I'm at the shrine, I imagine myself at ten years old. Today, I'm over 60. I'm with my grandparents and lots of gypsies and family members who are gone. I'm in communion with them. I think of how my ancestors lived. Many of them lived in horse-drawn caravans. And they would sell the horses to take the train together to Lourdes. Inside the Sanctuary, you can almost touch the kingdom of heaven. Rich and poor alike come to Lourdes. So do the disabled, the blind and the lame. Just like Jesus' followers, 2000 years ago in Jerusalem. Who were his followers? He ate with the fishermen, the people of ill-repute and the handicapped. You find the same kinds of followers at the grotto today. Blessed Virgin Mary, I have brought you a young priest, who is gravely ill. Please pray for his recovery with us. Our priests are so precious, Mother Mary. Thank you. - Can you push? - Okay. - Who's it for? - Augustin. Can you write it down for me? Jean-Baptiste wants to talk to you. Hi, Mommy. Hi, honey. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm okay. What did you do this morning? I filled the baby bottle. For Augustin. That's wonderful! We'll be able to fill the Virgin Mary. He'll drink water from Lourdes. Did you ask Mary for anything? "Thank you", "forgive me" and "please”". I told Mary I was sorry. Did you say, "Please, Mary"? I prayed in the street. This morning, we ate croissants. How nice! Don't forget to pray for all the people at Lourdes who are asking for mercy or miracles. Pray that Mary and the Lord will hear them. I Will. - I love you, honey. - Me too. Don't squeeze, okay? You understand? I have truly sinned. And so, I beg the Virgin Mary, the angels, the saints, and you, my brothers, to pray for me to our Lord God. Daddy? Yes, Pumpkin... What is it? What's your name? Maite. Rita? Maite. And you? His name is Jean-Baptiste. Jean-Baptiste, okay? Jean-Baptiste. - Where are you from? - France. Her name is Maite. She and her father were in an accident. Her father died. She's been in a wheelchair ever since. How are you? Very good. Are you okay? She says "yes". She's giving you a kiss. Nearer my God, to Thee To Thee, e'en though it be A cross that raiseth me Still all my song shall be nearer, My God, to Thee Nearer, my God, to Thee Nearer to Thee! Those of you who have been hurt by spite, dishonesty, or betrayal, you know these things leave a mark. In your heart, ask the Holy Virgin to look at you. She doesn't look at you as prostitutes. She looks at you as people. Holy Mary... I have been prostituting myself for years. I tried so many times to stop. But I just can't do it, Mary. I've been mocked, beaten and dirtied. And you've always been there to protect me. I've spent hours on street corners, praying to you. Only You can console me. I was born male. But, to be myself, I need to cross-dress. Only You can understand me. Why am I judged? Why do so many mock me? I've never hurt anyone. The only person I've harmed is myself. I've endured everything. I've done it all. I'm afraid of dying alone. Blessed Holy Virgin, I know that whores and transvestites will have their place in the kingdom of Heaven. It's great here, isn't it? Go slowly. Go! Slowly! Yeah! Keep going! You did it! We got it! Rest it there, or you'll have to... No, move it back. Further back. Like this. That's perfect. Here is good. It should be near the leaf. This is a good branch. Yes, it is. Last year's was a little small. We sinned more this year. We're leaving in a half-hour! You have a half-hour to finish the cross. Wait, we have to place the ferns. We're meeting under the big tent at 1.15 pm. I want to see all of you there. Everyone must come. Ladies, please hurry up and finish doing the dishes. Hurry up! Twenty minutes. Gentlemen, button your shirts. We'll be passing the grotto, so dress appropriately. We're waiting for you. Two minutes left. The mystery of the Calvary The scandal of the cross The Master of the Earth A slave to this wood! A small price to pay You alone are the Savior You alone are the King of glory Amongst the many wrongdoers Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those... Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. They didn't nail Jesus' hands. They purposely nailed his wrists! That's where it is most painful. Jesus is dead. Dead and gone. He was a prophet, a great speaker, whatever... But he's dead. Well, he was resurrected. He is here, with you. He'll never abandon you. The Stations of the Cross help us to pray that we become friends of Jesus. Eleventh Station: Jesus is nailed to the cross. Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother. When Jesus saw her, and his beloved disciple standing nearby, he said to her, "Woman, here is your son." This is the moment of total offering. Through Jesus, Mary offers herself. She offers herself through him, for the salvation of all people. Mary knows that in this body, the body of her son, the flesh of her flesh, within this body lies all the mystery of God, and of the world's salvation. Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. Honey, can I come in? Can I pour? You can't go back to school with a knot in your stomach, worrying about what will happen and that sort of thing. You're counting on Bernadette this year. More than in the past. We save up all year. Each month, we put money in the kitty for this trip. Even though we could use the 20 euros at the end of the month. But I do it for you, because I love you. You're the apple of my eye. But my unemployment benefits are over soon. Don't go thinking you're St. Bernadette. You have to learn to defend yourself and come out on top. You're already on 12 pills a day. It's time to go home. Back to our families, to our everyday life. And for some, back to loneliness. My name is Jean. I belong to the Sons of Charity. I made a choice. I wanted to protest against this society that brings us nothing and leads us nowhere. I still dream of a better life. But I've learned that a better life has nothing to do with money, or sex or anything like that. Sometimes... I get mad. I brood. I'm angry at life. The poor, the wounded and the broken... this may sound bad, but they're inconvenient. They bother us. I've given communion to sick people, to the crippled. I would look at their twisted faces, and they would bother me. They would prevent me from feeling settled. They would prevent me from being comfortable. I'm afraid to let them down. I'm afraid I'm not good enough. I don't know how to deal with them. I live with this fear. This fear is always within me. Holy Mary, I ask you to give me the courage to overcome my fears. My fear of others. And maybe my fear of myself, too. To me, Lourdes represents a way of surpassing myself. Here, I dare appear with the others to say we are deformed and ill. It is terribly difficult for us to do what others do effortlessly. We hope to keep ourselves alive, in the noblest sense of the word. A disability is a physical display of suffering. But it's only a reflection of all the internal suffering that we endure. In Lourdes, we can truly be ourselves, with all our strengths and weaknesses. I have trouble asking to be healed. I have to force myself. It's very strange. Why should I be the one to be healed, above all others? It'll soften the landing. If that's what it's for, then okay. Everyone here has received a death sentence. To think that you might be the only one saved is a hard thing to live with. It would be such an exceptional gift. I feel very humbled by the idea, and ambivalent as well. Very ambivalent. Holy Mary, give me the strength to dare ask to be healed, and to be able to return to a more carefree existence. Someone sent me this. An apparition of the Virgin. She appeared at the grotto. 300 people saw her. You can see her really well, in the back. Right here. It gives me the shivers. This image is really small. But if you look on that woman's phone... She filmed everything. You can see her really well. She's even wearing her crown. Look... You see her getting bigger? This is filmed from one phone to another. Go see those women over there! It's miraculous. It gave me goosebumps. You can see her rising up. That's definitely the Virgin Mary. That was yesterday evening. Here, you can see her very well. That's solid proof! She looks very small. But you can still see that it's her. You can see her silhouette. They took photos. I saw them. Sometimes, in the grotto, there's a woman who says, "Did you see it? Up there? "That's Christ's face, up there! In the hole." So you search... In your heart of hearts, you want so hard to believe, that you convince yourself that you too can see Christ. If you have faith, you can move mountains. You really can. It's the truth. I've been through a lot. If I didn't have faith, I wouldn't be here. My caravan broke down. My axle was broken. I cried, "I have to get there". And I did. I've been coming for 60 years. I can't miss it. I just can't. I will go home with a light heart, because I will have seen Mary and touched the rock. GYPSIES THE TRAVELERS' PILGRIMAGE Bernard shat in the shower. His diapers were disgusting. The bed was soiled too. So I thought I'd wash him up. But he shat again, in the shower. He just wouldn't stop. This is the last day. The day we don't like. We have to clean up... and go home... We don't like this day, but our guests don't either. They are emotional, and they're sad... to leave. How did your week go? Your week. How was your pilgrimage? This week... A little better. Well, tomorrow we'll be back home. Tonight, we take the bus. Goodbye, Sylvie. Are you feeling better? No, don't cry. We'll write to you. Joanna has your address. We'll write. To your house with all the flowers. Let's go see Vero. Calm down. She's sad to go home and leave everyone... Vero is coming. You'll be with your friend. - You've been great. - It was a good time. It was a good learning experience. They have so much love to give. I don't know... Look at that. He's happy. - We're eating out of your hand. - We sure are. - He's maddening. - He really is. Come on, stand up. Wouldn't that be great? And walk! - Say something. - Come on! I love you very much. Can the chair be tilted back? We'll tilt it and transfer you to the stretcher. We'll put it back afterwards. Pull both sides down together. Can we bend you forward a bit? A little. Just be careful of my arm. Can we lift your arm? Tell me if I hurt you. Is that okay? Let's take his arm. What about the harness? We'll use it, of course. We may use it differently than you'd expect. Am I hurting you? Under the legs? Hands under my knees. Why is it so cold, Daddy? It's spring water, honey. One, two, three... Everything okay? Let's give him some oxygen. Are you going in with Daddy? I want to go first. Stand on the first step. It's cold. May I ask you to cross yourself? In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. - Will you pray to Our Lady of Lourdes? - I will. We're good to go. One, two, three. - Great. - Can we lift you a bit? Watch out for the left leg. Yes, be careful of that leg. - It's important. - Okay. Stand on the first step. Now, step down. Will you state your intentions to Our Lady? Let's pray to the Blessed Virgin, okay? When you're ready, just let us know. In the name of the Father... the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Let's go. Watch the step. Closer to the Virgin Mary. Now, sit down so you can bathe. Sit down and lean back. - My legs hurt. - It's normal, dear. Sit on the ledge. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Turn around. You were a very brave boy. Lift him higher. Let go of the sheet. Hold on... That's it. Very good. Our Lady of Lourdes, pray for us. St. John the Baptist, pray for us. St. Augustine, pray for us. Slowly now. Let's go. Down, down. Our Lady of Lourdes, pray for us. Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us. Okay, let's lift him up. Bring him down. Watch your hand. Keep him straight. Ready? Perfect. Now, let's get the sheet. Are you okay, Jean? Adaptation: Holly Diener
