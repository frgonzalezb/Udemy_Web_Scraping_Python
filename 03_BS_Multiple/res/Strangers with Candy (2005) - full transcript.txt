IF WE DON'T RECEIVE CONCRETE PROOF BY NEXT WEEK, YOU WILL NOT BE RECEIVING ANY FUTURE FUNDING, AND AS REQUIRED BY LAW WILL RETURN ANY AND ALL MONIES THE BOARD HAS ALREADY PROVIDED. UNDERSTAND? BUT ALICE, I NATURALLY ASSUMED, THAT GIVEN OUR PAST LONG STANDING MUTUALITY THAT YOU WOULD PERHAPS BE MORE GENEROUS WITH YOUR LETTING IT SLIDE. OUR DAYS OF SLIDING ARE OVER. AM I MISSING SOMETHING HERE? NO, HENRY, YOU ARE NOT MISSING ANYTHING, AND NEITHER AM I. I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT, ALICE. ARE YOU? LET ME ASK A QUESTION HERE. DID YOU HAVE SEX WITH ALICE? YOU HAVE ONE WEEK TO PROVE YOUR STUDENTS ARE ABOVE AVERAGE IN ANY WAY. I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW. I'M ON THE SCHOOL BOARD.

YOU CAN TELL US. IT'LL BE OUR LITTLE SECRET. REALLY? UH, NO...I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THAT.. MAYBE YOU JUST NEED TO LOOSEN UP A LITTLE BIT. ARE YOU TRYING TO GET ME HIGH? NO, JERRI, WHY WOULD I TRY TO GET YOU HIGH? I SHOOK THAT MONKEY OFF MY BACK A LONG TIME AGO AND I WILL NOT GO DOWN THAT ROAD AGAIN.

A SUPERCONDUCTOR OUT OF SOUP CANS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE MAKING! WHAT ARE THE ODDS? WELL, OBVIOUSLY HE STOLE OUR IDEA! I DON'T SEE HOW HE COULD HAVE STOLE IT IF I SAW HIS FIRST. ANYWAY, ROGER'S GOT A REAL WINNER ON HIS HANDS, AND WE DON'T REALLY NEED TWO WINNERS, DO WE NOBLET? THAT WILL JUST GUM UP THE VICTORY. GET MY DRIFT? PRINCIPAL BLACKMAN, PLEASE WAIT... HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED? THEY STOLE OUR IDEA! PERHAPS IT WAS JUST A COINKIDINK. MEGAWATTI, DID YOU GUARD THOSE PLANS WITH YOUR LIFE LIKE YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA? WELL, SORT OF, AND THEN I GAVE THEM TO JERRI FOR A WHILE. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME FOR? EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'VE BEEN HANGING OUT WITH BRASON, JERRI. THEY DO? I MEAN I HOPE YOU CAN BACK UP THAT ACCUSATION WITH SOMETHING OTHER THAN FACT. COME CLEAN, JERRI. WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, I SUNG LIKE A CANARY? A SQUEALER, A STOOLIE? PEOPLE LIKE THAT ARE JUST SCUM TO BE SCRAPED FROM THE BOTTOM OF THEIR BOOT HEEL. I DID IT. I JUST LET HIM TAKE AN ITTY BITTY PEAK AT THE PLANS... WE WERE A TEAM! HOW COULD YOU BETRAY US? I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING TO HURT YOU FIGS! YOU'RE LIKE FAMILY TO ME, WELL, THE WHITE ONE. YOU DARKER ONES ARE MORE LIKE VALUED FAMILY SERVANTS. THE POINT IS, YOU'RE THE ONLY FRIENDS I'VE GOT IN THE WHOLE WORLD. MY DADDY'S IN A COMA! IT'S TOO LATE, JERRI. MEGS. TAMELAS. WHEN I WAS FIRST REJECTED BY THE PEACE CORPS, I DECIDED THERE AND THEN I WAS GOING TO TURN- - GEOFFREY. ROGER. I THINK WE NEED TO CUT AWAY A LITTLE BIT OF THE FAT BEFORE TOMORROW. I HEAR YOU.

IN WHAT KIND OF MAD FANTASY WORLD WOULD SOMEONE LIKE YOU AND SOMEONE LIKE ME EVER BE FRIENDS? BRASON. I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL NEVER EVER BE ABLE TO FORGIVE YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID TO ME. SO LET'S JUST PUT IT BEHIND US. NEW BEGINNINGS. I REALLY NEED YOU TO HOLD ME RIGHT NOW. BRASON. SO YEAH, LIKE, MY MUSTANG, WHAT'S SWEET ABOUT IT IS THAT- - OH DADDY... I WANTED YOU TO BE SO PROUD OF ME. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY EXCEPT I WISH I COULD TALK TO YOU. GOODBYE FOREVER, PEAPOP. [THUNDER] DADDY? DADDY, IS THAT REALLY YOU? OR ARE YOU JUST THE PRODUCT OF A DRUG ADDLED, ALCOHOL TAINTED DISEASE RIDDEN MIND? I BETTER NOT ANSWER THAT. WELL, THEN JUST TELL ME IF YOU'RE AS REAL AS SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS IN THE ROOM, LIKE THE DEMON WITH 100 EYES. THAT'S A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE. I'M AS REAL AS THE DEMON WITH 100 EYES. YOU ARE REAL! WHO'S THIS GUY? I REALLY CAN'T VOUCH FOR HIM. CAN WE GET ON WITH THIS? HUH? WE'VE GOT A COMA TO BE IN. I DON'T BELONG HERE, DADDY. NOBODY WANTS ME. NOBODY NEEDS ME. YOUR FRIENDS NEED YOU. YOU CAN'T LET THEM DOWN. YOU CAN'T LET ME'S DOWN. MAYBE I COULD COME UP WITH AN IDEA FOR THE PROJECT TO SAVE THE DAY! THAT'S A VERY GOOD START, JERRI. THANKS, DADDY. YOU LOOK WELL RESTED. [ MUSIC ] MAYBE THERE'S STILL SOME HOPE. HOPE? YOU FOOL. DON'T YOU KNOW DEATH WHEN YOU SEE IT? I'M BEING PUNISHED. YOU HAVE NO IDEA THE TERRIBLE THINGS I'VE DONE. CURSE GOD AND DIE! HEY FIGUROS. WHAT ARE YOU SITTING AROUND LIKE A BUNCH OF LOSERS FOR? GET OUT, JERRI! I MEAN IT! WE'VE GOT A SCIENCE FAIR TO WIN. AND I'VE GOT AN IDEA. NUMBER FIRST. DIG UP A CORPSE. NOW I KNOW WHERE ONE IS... KILL YOU! I KILL YOU! IT'S GO TIME, FATTY! JERRI! MAYBE YOU SHOULD LEAVE. I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP. HAVEN'T YOU DONE ENOUGH ALREADY? IT'S LATE, JERRI, WE'RE GONNA GO HOME. LATE? LATE? COME ON NOW. IN THE SLAMMER, SOME OF THE BEST STUFF WE'D GET DONE WOULD BE AT NIGHT. WE'D BE MIXIN UP THE JUNGLE JUICE SLAP ON THE OLD TRANSISTOR RADIOS. OF COURSE WE'D HAVE TO MAKE ARE OWN BATTERIES BECAUSE THE BULLS KEPT TAKING THE REAL ONES. YOU COULD TOSS A COUPLE OF D CELL BATTERIES INTO A PILLOW CASE AND USE IT TO SHATTER A PUERTO RICAN'S SKULL. BRITTLE SKULLS. OH, THE BATTERIES. OKAY RIGHT. SO WHAT WE'D DO IS TAKE OUR OWN POOPERS AND WORK IT INTO A PASTE, AND THAT WOULD MAKE THE ALKALOID. THEN WE'D FOLD IN SOME TIN FOIL FOR THE CELLS AND FOR THE ACID, WE'D USE OUR OWN SPIT. BATTERY. SOUNDS LIKE A BOMB. IT'S FINE LINE. THAT'S IT! WE'LL MAKE A BATTERY! AN ENERGY SOURCE MADE FROM NON-POLLUTING RENEWABLE MATERIAL! WELL IT POLLUTES A LITTLE- - DOODIES! WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET A PRESENTATION IN TIME. YOU WILL WITH MY HELP. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, GEOFFREY? AREN'T YOU ON ROGER'S BEEKMAN'S TEAM? THAT'S YESTERDAY'S NEWS, CHUCK. NOT REALLY, I SAW YOU WORKING WITH HIM LIKE AN HOUR AGO. WHAT DID HE DO?

ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE A LITTLE TIME AND A LOTTA WORK TO DO. MR. JELLINECK! OKAY. I'M OUT OF IDEAS. PERHAPS WE CAN PRESENT THE BATTERY USING THE TRADITIONAL MUSIC OF MY HOMELAND, INDONESIA. WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH A GOD DAMN BATTERY? NOTHING. WELL, NOTHING IS SOMETHING I'M USED TO WORKING WITH. I LOVE IT! LET'S DO IT! [ MUSIC ] HIDEY HO. SEE ANYTHING YOU LIKE?
