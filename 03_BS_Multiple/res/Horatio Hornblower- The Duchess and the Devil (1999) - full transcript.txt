HORATIO HORNBLOWER: THE DUCHESS AND THE DEVIL (1999) - FULL TRANSCRIPT

foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- I had one of them in my sights. Why not let me shoot? Because that is not my plan, Mr. Hunter. The plan? We're here to fight them, aren't we? No, we're here to defeat them. Bonjour, mes amis. Huh? Les Anglais! Hunter! Dubois! Dubois! No, it's King George, frog-face! Come on, men! Forward, men! You evil... attention... Oh... It'll take a bigger rat than you, boy. Quarter-deck, get the officers! I must ask you to surrender, Captain. Lay down your arms! Very well. To whom do I have the honor of surrendering my ship, sir? Horatio Hornblower, acting lieutenant of His Britannic Majesty's frigate, Indefatigable. Mr. Hornblower, where are the rest of my men? Lieutenant Dubois? They met with an... accident ashore. But they are unharmed. Do you want this one below, sir? You have my sword. I will not attempt to escape. I have already lost my ship. I will not compound my shame by breaking my word. Today the luck was with me, sir. Make sail for Gibrattar, Mr. Hunter. We will rejoin the Indie. Aye aye, sir. Mr. Hornblower's plan worked out handsomely didn't it, Mr. Hunter? Aye, it did. With some luck it did. Aye, well, he is lucky, our Mr. Hornblower. Got the devil's own luck. And we should make a tidy profit if those whoresons of prize clerks don't try to cheat us of it. Which they might well do if they find out how we cheated to win her. Sour bastard. Hip, hip... Hooray! Hip, hip... hooray! Hip, hip... hooray! The Indie's cheering us, sir. Thank you, Matthews. Keep your eyes on the job. Helm-a-lee. Aye aye, sir. Let fly! Douse the staysail! Come back on those halyards! And let go! The capture of Le Reve was the first successful action this squadron has taken against French or Spanish ships in the entire six weeks of blockade. Your plan was good, your execution excellent. Thank you, sir. By my reckoning though, Mr. Hornblower it has made you somewhat richer. That's why you wanted the Indefatigable hid, isn't it? Not at all, sir. So that her captain and her officers and her men would not have a share in your fortune. Sir, I do protest. That was not my intention. The captain is jesting. I see, sir, nevertheless... How much do you think the Le Reve is worth, Mr. Bracegirdle? A good Â£4,000, sir. Makes you richer by a thousand... Mr. Hornblower. Ever had a thousand pound? A thousand? No, sir, not even a hundred. Oh, well, at least you'll be able to spend some of it on a new uniform. I can recommend Cutler and Gross in Portsmouth. They'd be very happy to deprive you of some of your riches. Portsmouth, sir? Portsmouth. They want me to... I think they "request and require you to." Request and require me to take Le Reve to England. To Portsmouth. She is to be purchased into the service as a... dispatch vessel. The utmost expedition. England, sir? Yes, England, boy. A big, damp, foggy island, nor-nor east of Ushant. Think you can find it? Oh, yes, sir. Good. You sail tomorrow. However, before you slip your moorings, Mr. Hornblower I think you will find here a much sterner test. Their excellencies, Major General Sir Hew and Lady Dalrymple, request the pleasure of Sir Edward Pellew and... acting Lieutenant Horatio... Dinner? At Government House? Dinner? Bet you wish you had that new uniform now eh, Mr. Hornblower? What do I do if they ask me To carve, Mr. Hunter? I doubt they'd risk your ruining their dinner. Here, try these. Well, if they do, remember, carve away from the bone. Venison, thick slices. Mutton, medium. Beef, thin. And, uh, try not to saw at the chicken. Thank you, sir. Venison... Thick. Venison thick. Mutton, medium... beef. They won't have venison, will they? No. Gib's been beleaguered two years now. Main dish will probably be monkey. Monkey? Hmm. Um, rock ape. And monkey you mince with a sort of a... chopping motion. Monkey, mince. Chopping motion. Hmm. Thank you, Mr. Hunter. Most helpful. Ah, yes. Well, what you could do is stuff them with some of the surplus food. That'll take out the slack and, uh, give your starving friends a treat. I hear Sir Hew keeps an uncommon fine table. Perhaps you would share your good fortune with us. Oakum. Hokum? Sticking plaster, pads of oakum. Excuse me. May I introduce acting Lieutenant Horatio Hornblower captain of Le Reve. Good evening, Mr. Hornblower. Sir Hew, Lady Dalrymple. Captain? What, that puppy? Are you entrusting me to a mere babe, Sir Hew? Your Grace. If I may present Sir Edward Pellew captain of the Indefatigable and acting Lieutenant Hornblower Her grace, the Duchess of Wharfedale. Look at the lad. He's like a goose on a green. Any second now, he'll be hissing at me. Er, sorry, Your Grace. Oh, don't be, Mr. Hornblower. I expect you're right proud of yourself Getting a ship at your age. Gentlemen, my chef is of a combustible temperament. Let us not keep him waiting. Your Grace. Thank you. Come along. Your heatth, my lady. Your Grace. At last, Sir Edward. I was choking. Mm-hmm. Oops, I'm forgetting my manners. To you, Sir Hew. And to the lad and me having a safe voyage home. Oh. I hope your cellar boasts as good as this, Mr. Hornblower. My cellar? On your ship. You have to keep your passengers happy, don't you? Passengers, Your Grace? You have been given the honor, Mr. Hornblower of bearing her grace back to England. Yes. Yes, you sail with one of England's luckiest captains, Your Grace. Oh, why? Because he's got to cart me back to England? Yes, that too, yes. But while England's pride the great ships of the line and her frigates were beating up and down these coasts searching for the Spaniards and finding nothing but pilchards Mr. Hornblower here puts into shore with a couple of men and takes a French ship, her captain and the entire crew... with the exception of those he put to the sword, of course. I had many more than a couple of men, Your Grace. Look at that. Mr. Hornblower. You have the chef's masterpiece, I believe. Be so good as to carve it. Ooh, it's suffered enough, Mr. H. You don't have to kill it again. He's a lucky dog, that Hornblower, eh? He'll be tucking into the capons, roast beef, plum duff. Don't you envy him, Mr. Hunter? No, sir. Beef and biscuits does me fine. You, uh, sail with Mr. Hornblower tomorrow, do you not? Yes, sir. It goes without saying that he can depend on your wholehearted support. I am the King's man, sir. I follow my captain's orders. Yes, I was stuck In Florence when the French marched in, Sir Edward. So, I made my way to Leghorn bribed a coaster to bring me here and then, uh, well, bullied Sir Hew here into getting me a passage home. I hear the, uh, statuary in Florence is very fine, Your Grace. Somewhat naked, but very fine indeed. Oh, statuary, my arse, Sir Edward. I were there for my late husband's business. Keep those pesky Florentinos in line. You see, the Duke of Wharfedale owned mills and my father usd to manage them. Well, that's how I caught the Duke's eye. At least that's what my friends say. My enemies say I caught some'at else. Your Grace, gentlemen, ladies... The King. The King. The King. As for the enemy May the dons never leave their boathole in Cadiz. Ah, then, a bumper to the dons, Sir Edward. But, I doubt the Spanish will leave Cadiz For all their alliance with the French. They'll sit out the war and then sail forth to congratulate the winner. Perhaps. What is your opinion, Mr. Hornblower? Why have such a force and not use it? I believe they will come out to fight. And you hope you will be there When they do, don't you, Mr. Hornblower? Indeed, I do, Your Grace. There's two swivel guns on each side. We won't be able to put up much of a fight, sir. We won't put up any fight, Mr. Hunter; we will run. We'll head due south out of Gibrattar, Matthews. Put some sea between ourselves and any frog privateer lurking in Algeciras before we head west. Aye aye, sir. Once through the straits and off Tarifa we will set a course nor-nor west for Cape St. Vincent. Boat ahoy! Captain Pellew's coming aboard, sir. And, uh, a lady, sir. Nice dress, sir; good looking. Don't froth at the mouth, Styles. You've seen a woman before, man. Not in six bloody months, I haven't. Call this a ship, Mr. H? Welcome aboard, Your Grace. I'd be frit out of my wits crossing Thames in this. She's safe enough, Your Grace. Mr. Hunter will show you to your cabin. Thank you. Ma'am. Mr. Hunter. Mr. Hornblower. The port admiral gave me these. They are for the admiratty. They contain information worth more Than the whole of Jervis's squadron. Should you be boarded or even threatened with boarding These go to the bottom of the sea. Aye aye, sir. Well, wind is set fair. I say, Mr. Hornblower. Your Grace. I'm used to roughing it. But, um... but, I can hardly unbutton myself in that damn cupboard. Could you swap me your cabin? I believe Mr. Hornblower has already given you his cabin, Your Grace. It is the best I can offer, Your Grace. Oh, there I go again, putting my foot in my mouth. I do apologize, Mr. H. Well, I'm sure you want me out the way so you can sail the damn thing. Sir Edward... How can I ever thank you? No, not at all, Your Grace. Not at all. Well, she's all yours, Mr. Hornblower. Good luck, sir. What are you staring at? All hands to the windlass. Do you want to waste this wind? All hands to the windlass! Ma'am. Oops. Yes. Forgive me for disturbing you, Your Grace. I was wondering, would you do the honor of joining me for dinner? Oh, bugger dinner. When is this storm going to end? Storm, Your Grace? We have a fair wind and a calm sea. Leave me alone. It's coming up thick, sir. It'll be thicker by morning. Atter course, Matthews, due west. We can't risk not clearing Cape St. Vincent. Plenty of sea-room, sir. To atter course will only delay us. Thank you, Mr. Hunter. When I need your opinion, I'll ask for it. Atter course, Matthews. Aye aye, sir. She's, uh, quite some woman, that duchess Isn't she, sir? What's that got to do with attering course? Nothing, sir. Aye aye, sir. Mr. Hornblower, sir. Sir, Mr. Hunter asks won't you come on deck, sir. Good morning, Mr. Hunter. Shh, quiet. Listen. Dagoes, sir. Shh. We're in the middle of a fleet, by God. You should never have attered course. Yes, thank you, Mr. Hunter. Call all hands. Quietly. So, the dons have left Cadiz. Sir... Starboard. There. It's a two-decker, sir. The San Nicolas. 84 guns. Mr. Hunter, find the French colors. Sir? Le Reve's colors, man, run them up. The dons might not wish to fire on their allies. Aye aye, sir. It's a poor ruse, but it might buy some time. This fog could hold for five hours or five minutes. Mr. Hunter, what sail did the San Nicolas have? T'gallants and topsails, sir. Very well, take in the topsail. But the wind is fair, sir... And ease the sheets. I wish to slow her down, Mr. Hunter. Aye aye, sir. Keep her steady, Matthews. Aye aye, sir. You're hoping the Spaniards will pass us by. Hope is the word, Matthews. Hope and a prayer that this fog holds. Styles, in the stern, if you please. Inform me if any don sniffs us too close. Sir. Sir! Ship dead astern, sir. Course? Straight for us and gaining, sir. Matthews, three points to windward. Aye aye, sir. She's passing us starboard, sir. Abeam, sir. Sir. The sun. It'll burn off the fog, sir. Your hat. Hmm? Your hat, Mr. Hunter. That must be the Oriente. How many guns would you say, Mr. Hunter? Oriente... Guns, 74, sir. So if it came to matching broadsides I expect we would lose. But it would be a damn close-run thing. Don't you think, Styles? Damn close, sir. Take 'em at least a minute to sink us. Mr. Hunter. Go below, find what French clothes you can. Pass them round the crew. No man is to show his face above decks Unless he looks like a frog. Aye aye, sir. Oldroyd, get aft. Mr. Hunter has clothes for you. Aye aye, sir. Oh, I wouldn't say no To that dinner now. Shh! What? Have I said something? It appears we are surrounded by the Spanish fleet, Your Grace. I would respectfully suggest that you keep to your cabin. What? And miss all the fun? For your own safety, ma'am, and, dare I say it, for ours. What is it, Oldroyd? You might want to put these on. Very well. Take it to the quarterdeck. Tell Mr. Hunter All men to keep their own clothes beside them in the event we are taken. I don't want us all to be hanged as spies. Aye aye, sir. Trying to pass yourself off as a Frenchman, aren't you? Well, I would respectfully suggest That a well-dressed woman on your deck might add to that impression. As Your Grace pleases. Do you think you'll slip the dagoes, Mr. H.? The odds are long, Your Grace even for a gambling man. The breeze is freshening. We won't have refuge in the mist much longer. Mr. Hunter's compliments, sir. The wind's getting up again. Look. Keep her steady, Matthews. Aye aye, sir. At least her ports are closed, sir. Mr. Hunter, have Styles and Oldroyd Ioad the swivel guns with case. And to make it look like they're cleaning the guns not loading them. Styles, Oldroyd, starboard midships. Messieurs, identifiez vous memen, s'il vous plait. Le Reve, en route Pour Cadiz. Looks like they're sending a boat, sir. Nous avons I'honneur de preter I'assistance a notre confedere estime et valiant. He's offering us his assistance now. God damn him to hell. Sir, their boat's in the water. Stand by your gun. Fire on my order. Damn, they're everywhere. Sir. They're up to something, sir. They're signaling, sir. But what are they damn well signaling? She's opening her ports, sir. Le Reve, you must surrender. Je ne comprends pas. We know who you are. Surrender or we fire. Mais pourquoi? Nous sommes Francais! Sir, their boat's in range. Oldroyd, Haul down her colors. Aye aye, sir. Mr. Hunter, get everyone out of these damn costumes. Let's be taken for Englishmen, eh? Aye aye, sir. I must go below, Mr. Hunter. The deck is yours. I'm so sorry, sir. It was a valiant attempt. But it failed. Your Grace must excuse me. What have you got there? They are dispatches. From Gibrattar. I must ensure they do not fall into the wrong hands. Give them to me. I cannot do that. If you get captured, what'll happen to me? You will be transferred to a neutral ship or a neutral port, and then... Aye, and then? You will be returned to England. No, Your Grace. They will search your baggage. I have orders. You have information that will be more useful to the admiratty than at the bottom of the sea. Give them to me. If they found these documents on you your rank will not save you from the noose. I have as much right to risk my life for my country as you do. But how will you hide them? My skirts, where else? Who'll dare search there, eh? Who is it? Styles, sir. Come in. Dagoes are coming below, sir. Adelante, adelante. It's all right, Mr. H. Lieutenant Diego Romero at your service. Do I have your surrender? Acting Lieutenant Horatio Hornblower Of his Britannic Majesty's frigate, Indefatigable At your service, sir. Well, Mr. Hornblower. Your ruse almost succeeded. Unfortunately for you there was an officer on the San Ysidro who knew Le Reve and the manner of her capture. You play the rules of war very loose, sir. I play to win, sir. But here you are. Who is this lady, sir? Her Grace, the Duchess of Wharfedale. Muy encantada de conocerle, teniente...? Romero. Romero! Encantado. I never knew she spoke Spanish, sir. - We will take La Reve, - Mr. Hornblower. I'm sure my captain will be delighted to entertain La Duquesa. However, you and your men will be put ashore. I am sure we will be able to find you a prison to keep you safe for the rest of the war. Don't bet on it, mate. Maricones! Piratas! Mr. Hunter! Piratas ingleses! Vamos! My god! Kennedy? No. No. Go away. Go away! We must get out of here. Or we'll end up like him. We will get out of here, Mr. Hunter. And we'll take him with us. How? He's lost the use of his mind and of his legs. God knows how he ended up here, in this state But he was a midshipman on the Indie Just like you and I, Mr. Hunter. He was captured in action. Are you saying we should leave one of our own behind? No. But it will make our escape much harder. And success that much more satisfying. Archie, I need your help. We all need your help. We're going to work out how to escape. And we need to know how many guards there are. You'll never escape. I'd rather try than not. Five times I tried. Got further away from England every time. I should have saved myself the grief. But didn't you feel better for trying? No. Because the last time I tried they locked me up in a hole in the earth for a month With no room to stand up or lie down. Now leave me alone. He's given up. He wants to die. No use thinking of him. I will not leave one of my men behind. He's not one of your men, is he? And if he slows the rest of us down then what's the point? Mr. Kennedy is one of the Indefatigable's midshipmen, Mr. Hunter. What I heard was... He had a fit, Mr. Kennedy during a night attack and you had to knock him down in order to stop him getting the rest of you killed. What sort of a midship man is that? You were not there. You do not comprehend the circumstances. We do not leave without him. Aye. Aye aye, sir. Anyway, before we concern ourselves with Mr. Kennedy We must first consider how we get out of here. How do you read our situation, Mr. Hunter? What do you mean, sir? How many guards are there? That's clear enough. What are their weapons? Their weap... Their officers? Their morale? Their hours of duty? Their quarters when they're not on duty? We have work to do, don't we? Archie. Archie, it's all right, Archie. Archie, it's all right. Shh. Archie. Archie, there, there. It's all right. I was having a fit, wasn't I? Strange. I had not been troubled by them. Not until you came. Archie. I will not go back to the Indie. Do not ask me to. What is it, Matthews? It's the lads, sir. They think we should be doing something. Doing something? Aye, sir. Not just, uh, sitting about. We are sitting about until Mr. Kennedy is fit to escape with us. Well, some don't think he will get fit, sir. Look, Mr. Hunter's counted all the guards. He says there's never more than four on a watch. Now, he says we could take four easily. I mean, there was more than that on the Le Reve weren't there? Once we've taken these four guards what then, Oldroyd? What about the garrison? How many are they? I don't know, sir. You don't know. And neither do I. Until we know these things I will not risk your life or mine in folly. We go when I say we're ready to go Not before then. Aye, sir. What on Earth are you doing, Mr. Hunter? Weapons. We'll need these. Mr. Hunter, I do not doubt your courage, but... But what? You want to wait until the war's over? Mr. Hunter... It stinks in here. Come with me. Well, don't just stand there gawping. Come. This... is Lieutenant Hornblower Your Excellency. Mr. Hornblower, His Excellency Don Alfredo de Massaredo. Senora La Duquesa has begged a favor of me that you should be allowed two hours of exercise daily. And I would be happy to allow you to accompany her on her walks. But I must ask you first to give your parole as a gentleman that you will not try to escape. Thank you, sir. I'm happy to accept and to give you my word. However, sir, I must inform you That outside the hours of my parole I consider it my duty to attempt to return to my ship and my country. Hmph! So long as you do not try to murder me in my bed, sir I wish you every luck in your attempt. Here. How did you come here, Your Grace? Well, it seems the dons had a battle off Cape St. Vincent. So the ship that was taking me to Lisbon had to run back to Cadiz. They dropped me off here like a cask of beef gone off. Your Grace I must ask... the dispatches? Oh, I gave them up in exchange for a good room. Don't worry, Mr. H. They're hidden. Safe and sound. Oh, thank you, Mr. H. I can see I will enjoy our conversations. Our conversations? Yes. Every day, 5:00. Well, Your Grace cannot expect My presence here indefinitely. I consider it my duty to escape as soon as I can. Oh, yes, as you told Don Massaredo. And, uh... What about your dispatches? Well, they will come with me, ma'am. Will they? The dons will have no compunction About rifling your petticoats. So, we will converse exchange opinions, debate. When you are an admiral, Mr. H. And in society that is what will be expected of you. Not just your tacks and your jibs and your "Avast there, me hearties" but conversation. Quips, sallies, anecdotes and the like. You do have opinions, don't you, Mr. H.? No. Nor razors, neither. How was your walk? Interminable. Fresh air, attractive company. Very fine. Almost makes it worthwhile sitting the war out, doesn't it? The presence of the Duchess atters nothing. We'll escape when we can. And if she can be the means Of facilitating that escape, then all to the good. If you say so... Sir. Go on, you little beauty. Come with me. Good afternoon, gentlemen. The commandant has allowed me to pick some fruit for you from his orchard. Your Grace is too kind. Oh, stuff. It's the least I can do. Well, come on, men. Three cheers for Her Grace. Hip, hip. Hooray. Hip, hip. Hooray. Come on, Mr. Hornblower. Sir. We'll not be bought with this muck, lads. It's English beef we want. And English beer! And we won't get it sitting here. He's a lucky dog, he is, eh? He's thinking on something, Mr. Hornblower. You mark my words. He's thinking on something, but it don't concern us. It's how he can board Her Ladyship there that's what he's thinking on. No walk for you today, Horatio? No. It must be something to walk in the sun with such a lovely woman. Do you have a sweetheart in England, Archie? Archie? Archie. Archie... Archie. Archie! Guard, guard! Hunter, get help! Why? Archie. What's happened to him? Starvation. We gave him the same rations as us. But he didn't eat them. Why not? Why didn't you tell me? I assumed you knew. What is this? He's dying! Archie, why did you do this? Mr. Hornblower. What's happened? He hasn't been eating. He starved himself to death. And I didn't notice. Because I was too busy promenading on cliffs having conversations. The crown of the earth doth mett, my Lord. O, withered is the garland of the war. Archie, what are you saying? Shh. Don't fret yourself. Nothing left remarkable beneath the visiting moon. What was he saying? He's delirious. No, no, no, it wasn't like that. It, it was from something. No, Simpson! Archie, shh. It's all right. Here. Drink. You're going to drink. You're going to eat. And you're going to get better. And then, we're going to get out of here. No. Well, don't you want to get back? Hmm? Stand on the deck of the Indie? Hear the wind In the rigging? And hear how Horatio Hornblower rescued his shipmate from prison. It wouldn't be like that. It would be just like that. You'd do the same for me if I were in your shoes. But you're not. And you never would be. Archie... I won't survive if you don't help me. None of us will. You don't need me. You're one of us. We don't leave unless you do. You can't let us down. You must get strong. Now drink. Guards here, here, here... Here. The alarm bell is here. The guard nearest the alarm bell has to be disarmed first. Is that clear? Come and join us, Oldroyd. There's always room for a good man. Excuse me. Gentlemen. Oh, I wouldn't worry about Mr. Hornblower, Oldroyd. He'll be busy for an hour or two. How are you, Archie? Hungry. Good. I shall ask the innkeeper immediately. Roast beef, perhaps? Ham and eggs, a trout or three? Horatio, there's something I have to... Ah, don't worry about a thing. Let's just get you back on your feet again, eh? No, listen to me, Horatio. It's the Duchess. She isn't a duchess. She might be Cleopatra, but she's no duchess. Archie, what are you talking about? Cleopatra over Anthony's body Lady Macbeth, Beatrice, Gertrude. She's an actress. You're raving. No, I'm not. Her name's Katherine Cobham. I knew Drury Lane like it was my home. My word on it, Horatio. She's an actress. Mr. Hornblower? Don Massaredo. I would be honored by your presence at dinner tonight. I have a guest Colonel Etienne de Vergesse, of the French Army. Thank you, sir. Don't forget to bring us back a few scraps, sir. Some fruit. So, Mr. Hornblower. Her grace tells me that you were careless enough as to sail your ship straight into the middle of the Spanish fleet. I must protest, sir. Those were not my words. But that was your meaning. Come. Colonel, a truce prevails here. Fog and wind can make fools of any man. No, I meant no offense to Mr. Hornblower, Your Excellency. And besides, I was going to thank him. If he had not made his unlucky rendezvous we wouldn't have the pleasure of Her Grace's company Tonight. It is some years since I was in London but I believe, madam, we may have met before. I don't recall it, sir. Did you find London pleasing? After a fashion. I confess that, compared to Paris I found it dirty and crowded, and the food, well... But your theater, on the other hand second to none. Is it true there was an engagement off Cape St. Vincent recently, sir? There was. Do you wish to embarrass a Spanish gentleman in front of his guests? The Rivals, madam. That was one of the plays I saw. I hear it is a sad piece. Oh, no, madam. Most comical. Oh. I prefer tragedy. But it is more than a comedy. It is a play about deceit. You know better than me. I'm not often in London. I didn't like that froggie gent, Mr. H. Not at all. He seemed to like you. I've no idea why. Perhaps because you were in the play he saw. The Rivals, was it? Or perhaps it was Macbeth. Though I do believe you would have made a fine Lady Languish, Miss Cobham. Do you deny it? Why should I? But I don't understand. Why? Because I want to go home. But this whole... this charade, the Duchess of Wharfedale. She exists, exactly as I played her. Where are my dispatches? Hidden. Give them to me. Am I untrustworthy without a title? You are untrustworthy because you lied. The dispatches. Who is it? De Vergesse. May I come in? Follow my lead. I didn't know you were already entertaining, madam. Oh, two prisoners keeping each other company, that's all. Two very interesting prisoners. The actress who pretends to be a duchess. The boy who pretends to be a captain. I take offense, sir. It is, of course, an excellent way of gathering information. The duchess and the English naval officer whose ship just happens to sail into the Spanish fleet. You give him too much credit, sir. Do I? I wonder what the penatty for spying is here. Death for him, certainly. And for you, Miss Cobham in the New Republic of France the guillotine does not discriminate between sexes. I confess, sir. You confess what, madam? To my foolishness. For trusting this boy. Had I known he would sail me into a nest of dons I can assure you I would still be resting in comfort at Gibrattar. This is such a dull post to be imprisoned on. I have no one for company except an old aristocrat and a callow youth. It does me such good to speak with a man at last. But to whom to I talk? The duchess or the actress? Both the actress and the duchess want to go home. Let us say you are talking to the woman. Horatio, are you still here? But, Your Grace... Go to your cell, Horatio. What's wrong, Horatio? Just planning our escape, Archie. What do you want? Your lack of civility does you no credit, sir. How was your friend, Colonel de Vergesse? He is not a friend. You were more than friendly. I did what was necessary to preserve my alias. It is lucky for you that you had such a valuable bargaining card to hand, wasn't it? Oh. You still have them. Clearly. It is lucky for you that last night I had another card to play. At least it bought his silence. But how could you? What is it to you? Are you jealous? You completely misunderstand me. If I resisted de Vergesse he would announce my secret which would lead to my arrest as a spy and the discovery of your precious dispatches. So I sacrificed some small insignificant things such as my pride and my self-respect. Your Grace... Miss Cobham. I am sorry. I spoke hastily. But had you told me at first... Would you have given me a passage? Would you have entrusted His Majesty's secrets to an actress? Ma'am, please. I would have been honored to have you aboard my ship whether you were the Duchess of Wharfedale or Kitty Cobham or any woman seeking refuge. But the dispatches... no. And now? Now that I know you I would be grateful if you would keep them for me. What, you expect me to cart the damn things around in my underwear again? If Your Grace would be so kind. Thank you, Horatio. At present there's only five of us. Mr. Hunter. Mr. Hunter, Mr. Kennedy is getting stronger by the day. He will soon be able to move. I know that you have been making plans. What information do you have as to the garrison here? I would have thought you had the information Seeing as though you dine with them every night. Now I would like to sleep. I have bad news for both of us, Mr. Hornblower. The Duchess has left on a sloop called the Almeria bound for Portugal. So both our days are darker for her absence. They will be, sir. However, she left you, at least, a parting gift. She fett that you should learn my language. So you have here a lexicon, and this book. It is the story of a man who jousts with windmills. Her grace thought that you would understand him. Something's going on, Horatio. I know. What are you going to do? You speak Spanish, don't you, Archie? Hmm? I do a little, yes. What are you doing, Mr. Hunter? Doing? I'm getting us out of here. And how are you planning to do that? Before I tell you I must ask you whether you are with us or not. You are dangerous close to insubordination, sir. I am only doing my duty, sir which is to escape from here and return to fight for my country. He's right. Let us say you succeed in overpowering the guards, Mr. Hunter without the loss of too many of the men. What then? Then we take ourselves a boat. And what if there are more soldiers to prevent you from taking yourselves a boat? Then we'll fight them. No, we will go to a part of the coast which is less well defended. North or south? Makes no difference. Wherever there are boats. And who can speak Spanish to ask where these boats are? To find food? Water? Clothes to disguise the fact that you are English sailors escaped from prison Tith the whole country in arms against you? Listen carefully. We go when I say and how I say. And we go together. Kennedy will slow us down. Kennedy speaks Spanish. He will save our lives. Now, are we agreed? Oldroyd? Yes, sir. Aye aye, sir. What does this mean, Archie? Digo, paciencia y barajar. Hunter's up to something. Are you sure? He is, now, over there. Right. Consider your options... Sir. What is it, Matthews? We didn't know, sir. Didn't know what? Help us! The fool. Por favor. Help us, quick. Por favor. He's sick. Que paso? What do we do, sir? They're our shipmates, aren't they? Oldroyd, behind you! To me, lads! Apuntar armas! Mr. Hunter... Not now! We are outmanned and outgunned. It's not worth it. Afraid, are you? No! Think of the men. This is suicide. I'd rather die of a bullet than stay in here. At them, lads! Hold your fire! Hold your fire, sir! Descansen armas. Let me at him. Let me at him. Let me die! Matthews, Styles. Take him back to the cell. Let me die. No... Come on. Two of my men are dead. Three are badly injured. I want to know who is responsible. I am, sir. You? I cannot Believe it. Nonetheless, sir. But you gave me your parole, Mr. Hornblower. I gave it between certain hours of the day, sir. Beyond that, as I informed you it is my duty at all times to attempt to escape and return to my ship. I do not believe you. I do not believe you would lead such a vicious and senseless assautt. You would know it was doomed to fail. Give me the instigators, and I will deal with them. There are no other instigators, sir. Mr. Kennedy is a friend, is he not, Mr. Hornblower? He will tell you I am not afraid to be cruel. One last time, who was responsible? Tell him, Horatio. It was me, sir. I am... disappointed. Your men are confined to their cells. And you... This is all you, Oldroyd. You bloody idiot. Captain told you not to go for it. Oh, and how was I to know, eh? Course you bloody knew. Following a sawdust-for-brains bastard like Hunter what do you expect? Mr. Hornblower would've got us out of here. He would. He'd have walked us down to the harbor, nice and easy. Found a nice little boat. Sailed us all the way back home, no problem. Now look where you've got him. How is he? I don't know. It depends how long they keep him in there. It sent me nearly mad and I could not walk for a month after. There. You must eat. Eat. Stay strong. He'll need you. Come on. Matthews! Styles! Over here, quick! What? Ah, thank the Lord for that. Do I have your parole, Mr. Hornblower? You do, sir. Then your privileges are returned to you. Horatio. Are you all right? Yes, Archie. Apart from feeling that I've been bent in two. How is your leg, Mr. Hunter? It's well, sir. Well, thank you. Good. Good. Oh, dear. What ships are they, sir? Ah. I know our ship, senor. Yours. You must tell me. It's the Indie. It's the Indefatigable, sir. It's my old ship. Ah. Your ship has chased ours far inshore. But she's not catching her, I think. No, sir. But your is carrying too much sail. She must tack soon. The Indie will have her then. The Almeria's a good sailer, senor. She will be hard To catch. The Almeria, sir? Don't worry. She has had time to sail to Oporto and back. She will have landed her cargo. She must tack now. The topsail's gone. She is lost. Look, senor. Oh, my god. Will she Clear the reef? Not with her topsails gone. The devil's teeth will have her. We must launch boats, try to save them. In this sea? The fishermen, surely they would go? That would be folly. I know this beach, senor. Many have died in calmer seas than this. Sir, I beg you. Give me two carts some timber and some rope and as many people as you can muster. And, sir, I will need my own men. Of course. This provides you with the perfect opportunity for escape. Sir, those men out there are dying. The water is bitter cold. The strength is ebbing from their limbs but we can save them. They are your enemies. The sea does not take sides, sir. I give you my word. And that of your men? You have my word, sir. Go. God speed you. We need barrels. Small ones, like this. Lash them under the thwarts for buoyancy. Hurry! You will need a sail, food and water. You may have to stay at sea until the wind changes direction. Yes, you are right. Thank you, sir. Mr. Hornblower, sir. All is ready. Thank you, Mr. Kennedy. No, Mr. Hunter. Yes. Let me come. Please. Right, lads, put your backs into it. Now row! Row your hearts out, row! How many? Only five. Now four. Row, you bastards, row! Heave! Heave! Hold her here, men. Oldroyd, Styles! Bail for your lives! All of you, jump. We'll pick you up. All of you, jump. No, wait! Now! I'm all right. The captain's leg is broken. Can't you go closer? No, we would all be lost. He's jumping, sir! Can't you help him? Oldroyd, throw him a rope! Hunter, no! Hold on! Help, lads! We got him, sir. Mr. Hunter. Give me your hand, man. Look out! Mr. Hunter. Mr. Hunter! Where are you? Where are you, Mr. Hunter? It's no good, sir. He's gone. Oh, God! Sir, we must get back To the shore. We'll never make it. We'll have to stay at sea and ride this out. I thought it was you. As soon as I saw this little boat I thought, that's my Mr. H. I thought you were safe at Oporto. We came nowhere near Oporto. The captain insisted on running every time he saw an English sail. Ma'am, will you allow me to ask you a question? I believe I can guess. I have guarded your dispatches, safe and sound. Thank you, ma'am. Sir. A sail, sir! Heading which way? She's hove to, sir! Wake up, everybody! Everybody, wake up! Wake up, men! And row. Row, you beauties! Sir. It's the bloody Indie! Ahoy! Ahoy! It's Hornblower. He's escaped. Hornblower's escaped! Mr. Hornblower, sir. This is a most unexpected pleasure. As it is for us, sir. Your Grace! Uh... take her below. Call the surgeon. Get her out of those... Uh, Mr. Hornblower, you, your men and your... friends below with you, too. Mr. Bowles, spirits to warm them. Double ration, if you please, sir. Aye aye, sir. I must go back at the first opportunity. I gave Don Massaredo my parole and I gave it for my men. You must do as your honor dictates but I do not believe in this regard you can speak for your men. Well, sir, I prom... No, they must decide for themselves. And I will not think any less of them If they are not so punctilious in matters of honor. Ah, I trust Your Grace is more comfortable. Oh, I am, Captain Pellew. But after a night on Mr. Hornblower's rowboat I think I'd sleep easier on a perch in a parrot's cage. We have orders to make for England, Your Grace so God and a fair wind willing you should be in London before the month's end. Well, in that case I've got something to share with you. Before the dons took his ship Mr. Hornblower entrusted these to my safekeeping. The admiratty dispatches you gave me, sir. You burdened Her Grace with such matters Mr. Hornblower? Her Grace damn well insisted. I believe they are important. Yes, I know They're important, man. Gibrattar had me searching Half the atlantic for them because you decided to go missing. Don't be so hard on him, Sir Edward. Your acting Lieutenant Hornblower Is an extremely gallant and resourceful gentleman. Is he? Mm-hmm. I'm afraid he is no longer my acting lieutenant. As a resutt of exemplary gallantry in the fire ship attack on Gibrattar an opinion confirmed by three captains, no less... captains who would not normally agree even on the color of an orange. His promotion was confirmed in the last dispatches. He is now commissioned Lieutenant Hornblower. Thank you, sir. Well, let's see what your men think of you, eh, Your Grace? That's the real test of a gentleman, hmm? It would seem that Mr. Hornblower has been most unkind to you, men. He has given his parole to the dons that he will return. More than that he has given your parole. However, his word does not bind yours. You are free to remain here with your comrades aboard your old ship. Or you can return with Lieutenant Hornblower to imprisonment in Spain. If Mr. Hornblower has given his word that holds good for me, sir. Does he speak for all of you? He does, sir. Very well. Mr. Bracegirdle, set course for land. We will go in under a flag of truce. Aye aye, Sir. What will you do, Ma'am? You cannot continue this in London. I have friends... in high places and low. Friends who value me enough to forgive the manner of my return. In that case, I can only wish you good luck, ma'am. Stand by to run out. Horatio. I will always count you as I hope you will count me, among those friends. In high places or low, ma'am? The highest Mr. H. What's going on, sir? They're firing a salute for us, Matthews. Good luck, lads. Almost feels like home. A letter has come concerning you, Mr. Hornblower from their excellencies in Madrid. Yes, sir? The first minister has informed me that in recognition of your courage in saving life at the peril of your own you and your ship's crew are to be set at liberty. We are free to go? That is what I usually understand "liberty" to mean. Thank you, sir. I am honored by their excellencies' consideration. Mmm. I wonder if their excellencies realize They're setting free a man who will doubtless be a thorn in their sides for many years to come. I shall endeavor not to disappoint them, sir. Hmm.
