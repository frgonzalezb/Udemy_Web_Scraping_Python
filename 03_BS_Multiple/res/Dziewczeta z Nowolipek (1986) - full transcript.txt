But we shouldn't cross the street. They're, you know... Yeah, you might have to go to confession. I'm going home, or else there will be trouble. I'm going, too. I've made plans. Wait up, Amelka. I don't want to go back to the shelter, I'll go see mom. See you tomorrow. Good morning, Mr. Majewski. Good morning. Will you ever learn to close the door? You're letting the cold in. Mom, it's all over. Look at my diploma. You were rummaging through the apple basket again. What were you looking for? What do you think? If I catch you taking their apples again... Fine! Don't get mad! I'll do everything in a second. Fry the herring, peel potatoes... I know. Don't turn on the light! I don't have money to waste. This is serious! That mandolin is important to me. For everything. The unfinished school. Everything. Is it my fault you got sucked into those strikes and didn't finish school? How can you say that? You know exactly how it was. Ignacy managed somehow. Stop it, you two. Ignacy? You arranged for Ignacy to go abroad. That's true. I am going abroad to study. Here, have some money. Now leave me alone. Always problems in this house! He's been mad as a dog recently. Men should be like mad dogs from time to time. You know, I like coming here. Coming from my hotel room, it's nice here, like a real house. Bronka, go to Marszalkowska street and see Mr. Ruzycki. He owes me money. Well, I'm going to go now. I'll stop by tomorrow, Auntie, as usual. Bye, Janeczka. Bye! How long will you be gone, Ignacy? I'm not sure how long. (shouts in Yiddish) ICE CREAM So this boy goes to see the pharmacist and asks if he's got any cough syrup. The pharmacist says "no", so the boy replies, "you pig!" Amelka! Good morning. Good morning. Invite the young man in, and you can talk over tea. Oh, actually, I have nothing to go with the tea. Maybe I'll go get some cookies. It will be really nice to meet you. Be right back. I sowed on some flounce and shortened it a bit. Here. Isn't it great that I didn't sell the house after Father's death? We still don't have any money, but at least people can't tell. No one knows we're poor. Well? Fabulous. Walk around a bit. Beautiful. You know, I got you a job under Seweryn. You're going to be embroidering rich people's bed sheets. Maybe you'll meet someone. You never know. For instance, today. The prince's maid came, in person, and asked to have his old bed sheets patched up. Come here, honey. Come. Who is this boy? The one who's coming. Roman is a merchant's assistant. And I won't go to Seweryn's, I'll go to the stylist's. You're going to go to Seweryn, and you'll patch up bed sheets, Amelka. I said I'm going to the stylist's. We'll talk about this later, Amelka. Smile when he comes in. And be nice. Mom, when's dinner? Mom, we're hungry, hungry, hungry! Pots! I'll fix your pots! - Thank you. - Go now. - Good bye. - Good bye. Come back here. What's this? How can this child be made to eat outside? Jozefowa says that she doesn't like to come in here. That's true, Professor, she doesn't want to disturb. Really, I don't mind... I heard that you've finished school with high marks, and you want to continue studying. My wife can help you. She's got a lot of time on her hands, isn't that right? Yes, of course. Come in, you two can talk. I have to go now. I'll be back at 9. Well, come in... if you'd like to try. Thank you, very much. Really. Our mistress already arranged something for us. I don't need anything. And I'm really in a hurry. Franka! I'm sorry, mom! Good, you're here. We have to close. Thanks. ...at the end of the street, there's a window. Dark, abandoned, without curtains or flowers. The man stands there, and waits. For a long time. Finally, he approaches nearer, pulls himself up, presses his forehead against the window, and sees... endless darkness. And there's... Oh, our poet's finally here. Maybe she was looking in dark windows again. Give that back! Hold on. There are still poems here, listen up. I love you, shining star high above... I long in vain... What is the meaning of this? Franka? Nothing. Really, it's nothing. Well, you're finally here. I came here for the money. Obviously, but maybe we can talk about that later. I'm here about the order. My father sent me. You wanted a dresser, and a table with a glass top. With a glass top? Wait a minute, you're Mossakowski's daughter? Yes. OK, so... That's all right, have a seat. I'm sorry, but my father asked me to bring him the money. Well, listen, I still have a few orders for you. For instance, I can order the dresser. Maybe some sort of divan. Maybe a chiffonier. Instead of that, maybe we should have a drink. I'm really in a hurry. Well, sure, if you really want to. I... know... you... Too well... And you know me, A day or two... Or three... I'm sure that's too much. Why? That's in advance for future orders. There's this small... table top... Please. How did it go? What do you mean? It was as usual. - You don't want to tell? - Maybe I don't. Good morning, Bronia. How's your mom feeling? Tell her we're always thinking of her. Do you have the money? Yes, the man said... Bronia, child, where have you been roving? Let's go. Did you bring the money? Dad took everything, mum. I can't believe she brought myrtle. It brings bad luck. I'll take it to the church. Mom! (speaks in Yiddish) Franka, is it a sin? What? Father with Cousin Helen. Why would it be? They love each other. But mother. Don't be silly. You've never been in love. And Ignacy? Get out of here, and don't eavesdrop! Where should I go? Milek's with his orchestra, and you're talking about love. They're calling for you to go outside! Not bad at all for your first time. There are no mistakes. Your answers were all good. Franka had even better grades than I did. We would both love to study further. The lawyer's wife will take care of Franka. I know all about your mistress. Here's the address, and if you have anything... Well, go on. Remember, tomorrow at six. Wait, I have something for you. These notebooks... they're not new, but there's still room to write in them. They belonged to a former student. I stopped seeing her, she stole from me. I swear that... Sure, don't worry about it. Go now. The notebooks. Don't forget them. (speaks Russian) I'm scared a bit. Stop it, you're always scared of everything. Let's go. I have a hole in my garter-belt. And so what? Let's take a side path. No way. Wait a second. See, they didn't tear us to pieces. Of course they didn't. If everything works out with the sets, I can give them to the high school. I don't need that, it's a complete waste of time. One day, I'll have a real store, like the Majewskis'. - Where's Franka? - Yeah, where is she? Leave them alone. He's handsome, and probably rich. Franka, what happened? Who was he? He asked what I was doing here, and if I like the theatre. And? He said that if I come here again, he'll give me tickets to the theater. You won't go, will you? I don't know. I really don't know. - Tell your father I'll be back tomorrow. - He's been coming home late, he's not working. Bronka! Mrs. Mossakowska. Do you know that there's a man who's interested in Bronka? That man came to the workshop. He's been here already. Yes, there was a man who was interested in my Manka, too, but I was stupid, and God knows where she is now. What's this stuff Masiakowa is telling me? I don't know what you're talking about. You know very well. You say you work and you go on dates. That's not true. Tell me everything! Tell me everything! I swear to God! Leave her alone, mom. He promised me work. He won't come here, again. I'm sure he won't. I'm sorry. But you know... Drink the old wine The 300-year-old wine! And make love to a girl A 16-year-old girl! Pay no attention to morals Your grandfather's nonsense Because he also had his fun When he was 16 years old! So throw yourself at her neck Cover her face with kisses Because you only live once Kiss her, and kiss her more! Like at a funeral! Because you only live once Kiss her, and kiss her more! Can't you sing any differently? Let's play something else. - Alright, let's play. - But what? I say we play "Messenger". "Messenger"? That's fun, but it's for kids. "Who's there?" "The Messenger." "With what?" "With a red-stamped letter." "For whom?" "For Miss Kwiryna". You guys have lost your minds. Knock, knock. Knock, knock. Well, go. We're supposed to play. I have to go home. Please, stay for a while. - Good night. - Good night. What happened? Nothing happened. They had to go. What do you mean "they had to go"? Where's Roman? How could you let him go? What was I supposed to do? Shoot him? Poison him? I'm sorry, I only wanted to know what about Mother? Please, come in. Please, come into the room. And sit down, for God's sake. We had to put her in a hospital. Everything should be fine, but it will take a little time. The doctors said... Why are you lying to me? I know. Listen to me. If you would like, you can stay here. You could study here full-time. It would really be better than that shelter. No. Are you finishing soon? Including the crushing, Miss, or no? Including the crushing. Including the crushing! Well, then, get in the barrel. That's everything. Thank you. Thank you. What, you think I'm going to crush the cabbage? I'm in a hurry. You know I've made plans. So she wants to date! Mom, this boy is a merchant's assistant, we have things in common. I've already told you this. Put on these, and tie them at the bottom! If you want me to crush the cabbage, you're going to have to pay me! I want to start making money! Do you want me to find a job somewhere else? Last autumn you had some interesting ideas, too. It's all because of those sets! If people knew, they would never buy this shit. I can't take it anymore. I'll show you all... I'll show you! Do you really think that I don't know why you're so protective of that apple basket? Can I have five sausages, please? No, make that four. You made a mistake, I asked for four. I never make mistakes. I've worked in this far too long to make mistakes. Take it, quickly. Thank you. - Bonjour. - What do you want? Idiot! I recognize you. You've been here before, right? You're in mourning now, aren't you? I'm sorry. You have beautiful eyes. Sad eyes. Has anyone ever told you that? No. Wait. You came back here. Why? I don't know. I bet you read a lot. You like poems. Right? Poems? I don't know. And those eyes. You could be an artist. I don't know. Stop saying "I don't know." Say something. Well? What's behind those eyes? Tell me a poem. I love you, shining star high above Away from me I stretch my arms to you in vain I long in vain... Wow, you really are talented. You could probably get into a specialized school. Do you want to see the play that I'm in? I don't know. "I don't know, I don't know." Come. Come. Well? Come on. We'll walk under the stage. Tell me the poem once more. Here? Yes. "Star", you said I love you, shining star high above - Away from me... - I love you! - No... no... - What are you saying? Quiet! - No! No! - Quiet! I love... this! I've had enough of these sets! The talking behind my back... Having to go get groceries, like a servant... A hangover is better than this! Stop it. I know you don't really think that. Why isn't she here, yet? This morning I got up first, so that I could get the paper. But some girl ran out from the publisher's in front of me, because she knew some guy inside. And now, wherever you go, everyone's busy. If everyone's like that, why should I be any different? If what you say is true, everything is senseless. Senseless? You just have to be clever. You'll see that Franka can succeed. She's good enough. We should get Franka some sort of skirt for the exam. Maybe my red one... We'll just adjust it a bit... What's wrong? I don't want anything anymore! What happened? I'll never take the exam! Leave me alone! You'll take the exam, Franka, you hear me? You'll take it. My dear, does Madame Prymas still live here? Mrs. Prymas isn't here, but if you'd like, I can go look for her. Thank you. I'll wait. Don't you have rehearsal today? I don't know. Something's wrong with Father. - Did you see who's here? Prymas's daughter. - Quiet. Father... What, did he get drunk again? No. I think he's really sick. He's in bed now. Raise your head a bit... Let him be. Listen. Maybe Father wants her to come. That monkey. She ran away with some other guy. - Manka! - Mom! Oh dear! No... No... Here's the tea. But, as usual, there's nothing to go with it. So I'll just... I've had enough of those cookies. I feel nauseous after eating them. Of course. I'll be right back with something more suitable. Amelka, that wasn't nice. Don't push it. Mom, stay out of this. I deserve this. You deserve this? Get up! Well? Get up. Don't slouch like that. Don't you understand? Or do you not want to understand? Stop talking like an idiot. Amelka... What happened? Somebody! Somebody! God have mercy... I can't take it! I can't! Jesus. I think Mosakowski died. They're going to be like us... all alone. Don't let him go, Amelka. Hold him tight. Hold him! Franka, we need to talk. You not still mad about before, are you? Can you tell my old lady that I have to work late? She won't believe me, but she will believe you. You know, there's a nice café not far from here. Let's just go there. I'll tell you everything. No. I can't. I have money. I have this guy. Well? What, are you scared? You're not a child. Come on. Someone's coming. Come on, get ready. Gather your stuff already. - Stop it. You're making a mess. - Come on. That is... Hi. Good morning. What, you don't recognize me? You haven't been here in a while. Are you done with school, yet? I'll tell you everything in a second. Hello. Please, come in. Hello. Do you have anything to eat here? Why is this out of tune? Well, it's out of tune... Come on... Let's get started. Hold on, one second. Seems I'm not welcome anywhere in this house. - Maybe I shouldn't have come at all. - No, one moment. I'll open up in a second. - I'll be going, now. - No, no, no! Alright, I've no other choice. I'm coming in. Good morning. Here, let me. So, what's Mietek's problem? He thinks that you ran away. And what do you think? I don't know. My going abroad to school was just a story for my parents. I was in Cracow for some political business. But remember, you can't tell anyone. You've changed. I always knew you'd do something. Come, Franka. What? What, Bronka? This is... This is so nice. I'll have problems at home, again. - I'll walk you there. - No, I'll go alone. Roman! Something happened at home. Oh, God. Let me through. Let me through! We have to inform the police. They've already been informed. Make sure no one touches anything. Such good people... Mr. Roman, what happened? Oh, God... Get out of here. Everybody out! The store was open even on Sunday. You see, sir, we had to earn as much as possible. And when I went for a picnic with my friends, they were working the counter as usual. Do you suspect anyone? - This was a murder for money. - I don't know. Well? Who came to the store most often? - And was anyone here regularly? - I don't know. I always worked in the back, and my mother never let me touch anything in the front. You know, a lot of people came here. Guards from the prison nearby. Sometimes, even the prisoners, that is, once they were released. Yes, I guess that's something to start with. I'm going to have to close the store. You have to go see my aunt. I really need her. If you want, I can go with him. He doesn't know where it is. It doesn't matter. He'll find it. Can Mr. Michalowski walk you home? Everybody please leave! The excitement's over! Oh yeah, and the store will never open again! Where are you going, Bronka? To see Kwiryna, mom! Where should we go? I don't know... ...how about forward? I didn't sleep at home last night. Family argument. My father reduced my pay, because of the trip. Your parents didn't know at all? My mom knew. I can tell my mom anything. Only she understands me. Maybe she's not the only one. You know, Bronka... Listen, you want to come up to my place? My friend left for Cracow, and I have keys to his apartment. Well? No. No? Yes. (speaking Yiddish) Bronka. We have to control ourselves. I'm sorry. It is I who should apologize. Bronka. Don't ever do that. Don't ever go for a man, no matter how much he begs. You hit me. I don't even know why. I didn't go for you because you begged me, but because... Because? I'm leaving for Cracow tomorrow. Probably for a long time. What's it even supposed to mean, "Fatherland"? I didn't know you could be so cynical. First, they tell me to hate anything Russian, and now I'm supposed to hate the Germans. You don't understand any of it. Why are words always used to reach specific goals? Looks like I didn't teach you much, after all. Where's my pen? Hold on. I have to tell you... we're going to have to stop our lessons for a while. My husband is being transferred, so I'm leaving also. But don't worry, I've thought of you. I've talked to people. I believe that the best thing for you, would be to take... obstetric courses. For a girl in your situation, it's a perfectly acceptable career. You'd want everything at once. Franka, the most "gifted" one... Please don't talk about Franka. Franka will pass for sure. Well, Franka hasn't been to her lessons in over a month. That's how grateful she is. I'm never going to be a midwife. Whatever you wish. But if you change your mind, go to Karmielicka Street. Where's my pen? Well, where is it? Go now. Go. And go to Karmielicka Street tomorrow. - Let's go. - Wait, we're about to go in. - But I don't have any money. - Don't worry, I do. I recited the poem well, but then they asked me about Fredra, but we had only learned up to Kochanowski. Then, we did the groceries, and cleaned the kitchen. Are you crazy? What are you going to do now? Whatever happens, happens. One day at a time. Look, I have a new bag, and I threw away those old shoes. I have a small restaurant nearby... - This is my friend Franka. - Good evening. And this is Bronka. Excuse me, I have to go home. It's on me today. No, no. It's on me. Bronka? Yes. Ignacy was here. He asked where you were. He wanted to say goodbye, I think he's leaving again. Listen, why was he so set on seeing you and saying goodbye? Bronka! Miss, that man left a while ago. Yes, but... Some new man lives here, but I haven't seen him today. (sings in Russian) Mom! Excuse me. My mother locked the door, and... Well, alright. Come in. I won't leave you out in the street for the night. Mr. Michalowski brought Amelka back in a carriage. She fainted at the cinema. Amelka caused quite a stir. All the men were running for help. Oh, God! I'm not well... Amelka. Amelka! Amelka, what did you eat today? Bronia, give us some tea, quickly! Amelka has anemia. She should leave, go somewhere with fresh air. Amelka doesn't have anemia. She's very healthy. Mr. Michalowski is right this time. I'm going to a friend's in Wawer. What? You don't have to worry, Mom. It won't cost anything. Just let me take some sheets and a towel. I'll leave you two alone. Please, don't leave yet. Stay here for a while with us. Please, I beg of you. Mr. Michalowski is in a big hurry. It's true. I really am. I'm sorry. You don't treat men like that. Stay out of this! Leave us alone. You'll regret this. Stop it, and calm down. Don't you understand, either? Are you deaf and blind, too? Or are you pretending? Bronka! I am to be blamed. I was cruel. Understand, I didn't want you to be unhappy... Wait a second! You're not helping. ...I'll repair it, but don't forget, all the big things go over here... - What about this? - What about it? Deal with it! You are still naive and defenseless... Remember, if you do something... You know what I mean... I don't want to see you... Mom said we're leaving. We have to pack. Well? Why are you standing around? We're evacuating! I'll come back from Russia rich as Mrs. Prymas! Keep quiet and do your job. I'm not going with you. Do you know what's going on? The Germans are almost here. Everyone's getting away. It's going to be hard here. Hunger. Over there, at least there'll be work. Don't be stupid. You'll find a husband there, right? I'll stay. I'll wait here. For whom? The Germans? Leave her alone. Let her wait. Go ahead, Bronia. Go on. Get in and sit down. You'll be late. But I'm not going. I told you Bronka isn't going, ma'am. You forgot the bird cage. May God guide you. Take care. We'll be leaving soon, too, as soon as Mancia's healthy. Captain Medvedev promised we'd leave by car. Let's go. Goodbye. Remember, Petersburg's station! The train with...! Otherwise, you won't find us! Bronka! Stay and don't go to the train station. Stay, clean up the apartment, otherwise when you go home tonight... you'll feel lonely. Attention, everybody! This will make your blood freeze! Take your kids away, they might not take it! Attention... This is miss Mossakowska. We know each other. I knew that you would come and see me again one day. By yourself. One second! I was just joking. Please. Please, have a seat. Please, tell me something about yourself. About myself? My father died, now everybody left. "I'm all alone...", right? You know, that job at the orphanage... My secretary is leaving soon, and if you'd like... I would like to thank you for everything you've done for us. I could have done more. I could invite you to dinner, for instance. If I can choose, I'll pick the orphanage. Of course you can choose. Excuse me, miss. I'd like it if you would lend me money. I'll give you my purse. Irena, right? Wait! Irena! Wait! You don't have to be ashamed. Tell me, where's Franka? I haven't seen her since last time. Franka has typhus. She's in the hospital. Of course, now it's the army! We'll talk when I come back. Don't touch me! I can't even look at you anymore. I don't want you to come back. Excuse me. I wish you good luck. I'll stop by again tomorrow to say goodbye. What are you doing? At this time? He said he has reserves at home. When he comes back, I'll apologize to him. No, you won't! I have everything. I'll pay back with all that I make. You will pay back? You? You're going to make enough for the apartment? Do you want to create bigger troubles than we already have? You're the one who brings trouble upon us! You're the one who showered him with gifts! You're the one who left me in the room with him! And now you act as if nothing happened! Oh God! God! Excuse me. I just wanted to tell you that Franka is in the hospital. Did we make the right choices in life? Amelka, what's wrong? Look. See the fingers? So long... And here's the head. I couldn't let them throw it out into the garbage! But now... Today, I understood. Everything's going to be different now. Tomorrow, I'll bury it at the cemetery. My stupid naivete will end. It's all going to end... She's not going to get anywhere. You see, it's all about having a life and a niche. The place where my mother worked is now vacant. You have to keep studying. In the end, I didn't reach much further than my mother did. You know, I always believed I would somehow pull myself out of this. But now... Don't, Franka. You can stay at my place for a while. You can rest, and then we'll see... There's this one guy. He can do a lot, but... No, I'm not going back to that anymore, and you shouldn't, either. You see, neither you nor I can close our eyes and fully give ourselves, or live properly like you're supposed to. It's too stupid, too restricting, too ordinary, too intelligent, too cunning, too fake. When you enter into life with this... dowry, like we do, we get the bottom of the barrel. Why did we go to those sets? What's the meaning of it? I've nothing to hold on to, not with my mind nor with my heart. We're just going to stumble through life, always pushed around. Stop it already. Alright. I'll stop it now. Oh God, you look awful. How's she supposed to look after typhus? - What did they do to your hair? - You can't touch me. Kwiryna, how nice that you found time to come down and visit me. I'm all alone now. They took Roman into the army. And so what? What does that have to do with anything? They take everyone into the army nowadays. You say that because they didn't take your old pharmacist. Pharmacist? Yes. I'm getting married. He's much older than me. Why do you stand idly? Again you didn't bring her anything to eat. Look, Franka, at what I brought you. Everything that was at the picnic. Apples. Some cake, and something to drink. I'm not supposed to take this. Visits are over. I have to go. Give all of this to the nun. (speaking German) - Take this. - Quick, come on. Good morning! Good morning! Is it you who's going to live here? - Me? - No. Me. She got bored of her previous place. Come on, show us the apartment. Where is it, in the attic? Something like that. The kitchen's downstairs, they give out bread there. And here's the room. Today is Sunday, so it's quiet. But on a regular day, you'll have all those kids running around. Alright, thank you, sir. Couldn't you at least have had the place painted? It looks awful. Where are the covers? Over there. Anyway, why didn't you bring the washtub for the laundry? Those things are useful at home. Do you really think I'll ever consider this my home? The two blouses I have, I can wash under the sink. With two blouses, you won't get far in life. Well, don't stand around! Make some tea, or something! Did you know I don't have any documents? I was under my mom's passport. I've even forgotten what year I was born in. Then you have to start everything from scratch. You now have a bed. And... Here's a present for your first birthday. I have to go, can't leave my aunt alone at the store for long. Well... Excuse me. I told you you can come in here anytime you like. I'll get dinner ready. Your wife said not to wait for her. Frania, would you like to have a drink with me? You look sad. You must be sitting down all day. But I'm constantly doing something. No, I meant outside, getting fresh air. After your illness... Shall we? So tell me, truthfully, how do you feel here? Alright? Alright? I've never had it better. Excuse me, I didn't mean... Soup! Soup! Calm down, Kids, calm down. Slowly. - Maybe we should ditch the fish? - Dunno. Kids, what do you prefer? With groats! We don't have any groats left. I'm glad you came. I want you to try this soup the kids have to eat. I saw two hungry kids outside. We don't have any more money, miss. We can't give them more than this. I don't recall you ever having money problems. I need that job you were talking about. For a friend. Why did you get so drunk? I got mad. I got a little mad. And that's why... You want some? I came to tell you I found you a job. You too? Dear Miss Frania, we have found you a more suitable job, but you can stay in your apartment until we come back. Take this. I don't want to ask you anymore. But please, stop drinking! Listen... Do you believe? I'm... not so sure anymore. It was different in the past. - But a person has to believe because... - Get out! Franka! I'm not asking you if you believe in God, but if you believe in love. You don't understand anything. Get out! Stop drinking! You don't understand anything! Get out! Franka. Franka! Franka! Franka! Franka! Franka! Franka! Bronka! Bronka! This is terrifying, you walking here by yourself. Almost made me sick. Why isn't Amelka here? People really are awful. So how did it happen? Stop it, Kwiryna. Don't talk behind a coffin. Do you know who that is? I said, stop it. What do you want? You're always pretending. You're just not skilled at love. I feel like I'm withering when I'm with you. Don't come back here again. So what do you want? Tell me, what do you want? Now, I want a lot. There's no way to pay for this. Have they been here yet? Don't worry. They already asked for tickets. Where is my dear beloved Poland? Is it free, or is it still denied? Where is our strength when we are in shackles? Do I have to die in a foreign wasteland? (shouts in German) Ignacy! What are you doing? They're not allowed to answer, anyway. I lost everything, my purse, my heel. END OF PART I Subtitles improved by bruno321 @ KG
