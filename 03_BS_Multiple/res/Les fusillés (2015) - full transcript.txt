foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Shot At Dawn It's here. Long live France! The soldiers! Unload your bags. Hey, lads! Get moving! I've room! - Whose is it? - Never you mind! Hold on...! We said I'd take you... Thanks, Mr Dulac. Bastien doesn't go by train. Let's go, ladies! Kisses, tears, get out your hankies. As for advice, you've got, "Don't catch cold", "Look out", "Be careful", "Don't forget to write..." Don't make fun. Smile, it's war! Kiss your papa. Kiss your wife, teacher. Goodbye, my darling. What do we say to heroes? Come back alive. - Mme. Dulac, may I? - Of course. Take care. - Bye, Mama. - Goodbye, Louis. - Sure I can't take you? - No thanks, Papa. - We might be late. - Louis! What's keeping you? Bring on the Boche! I can't get warm. When do you think they'll attack? Don't worry. - Here. - Thank you... Albert! Don't burn your balls! It seems the Hun aren't like us. Their dicks are on their heads! That's why their helmets have points! Can't you ever be quiet? It's not like ours back home, but it's better than the roller's! I met a farmer behind the lines. Who wants some? Me! Me! Me! Don't! He's drunk already. So what? You're not his mother. I've no money. You should have told me first. We're at war! Please! Too nice for my own good, as my father said. Enough is enough. I'll charge you double. Too many unpaid debts lately. Here you are. What? Credit is the way forward. Up your ass, Fritz! Are you crazy? You don't want me to shoot? Very well. Bring in the artillery. There you are. Heavy shell! Short! Adjust the rear sight! Come on, boys! Who wants a grenade? It's free. Louis, grenade? Support the war effort? Grenade? Free! Heavy shell! - Lengthen the bloody range! - Let's go! Let me see! It's not bad... With any luck, your war is over. Give me a drink, I'm thirsty. No... - You'd refuse a wounded man a drink? - A drunkard, yes. Scoundrels get all the luck. Take him to Boyau 16, the first aid post. Wait a minute... I was just checking. Who started this shambles? - The Boche, Adjutant! - The Boche! Shit! There! Your stupidity's going to get us all shot! I'm telling you! Are you all right? Look at me! It's all right, carry on. Nothing new from the Boche it seems. Hear anything? There's no digging. No tunnels, no mines... - We can go back! - Not so fast. The Lieut. says get some German wire to prove we went there, we get some German wire. That's orders. Hold on, boys... No tunnels, all's well. We're not arseing around with Fritz for the Lieut. Is this what you want? Regulation Fridolin barbed wire. You need anything, ask Bastien. Bastien stocks everything! Come on! Where is it from? Near the slope. Mevel cut it. Near the slope? Can you show me on the map, private? It was after the volley, Captain. It was pitch dark. - As for which slope... - It was near the Chaumont ruins. I've patrolled there, there's an elm. You can't mistake it. You're sure? No undermining or tunnels? We heard nothing, Captain. The army dislikes malingerers. At the army hospital, I saw torpillage sessions. You know? Electrifying the brain? Those smart Alec malingerers were longing for the Front. They injected them with ether to make them confess. Think, soldiers. Captain, we all want to fight. It's all Mevel wants. Like us. Like you. He's shocked, but we'll help him. All right, fall out! Ether? It's a joke. Hey, you heard what the captain said. Pull yourself together. Hey, Albert! Give me those. Come on. You won't? Give them to me. Keep them! You keep them, all right? To pen-pushers and malingerers! Don't say that. The earth's full of our friends' blood. We're in a living hell, they call us liars. - He's about to get his brain fried. - Come on, lads! They'll see he's sick. - And if not? - It's not our business. He's dangerous. We can't always save the day. He stays with us. Clear? No, it's not. Look at him. Did he ask to stay? To live like a damned soul? He's shocked, he'll be fine. No, he's gone. He's snapped and you don't want to know. Albert! Look. It's Gaspard. You've seen him. He's the class of 95 like us. He's a vole, not a mouse. Let me see. He's more like a shrew with that nose. Shut up. That's my opinion. A vole is useful. It kills vermin, like we do the Boche. You're like the vole. I'm too busy. Can you look after it? What do those things eat? - Worms. - No problem with all these corpses! Quiet! Gaspard? Take him. I'll take these. To the voles and the dead! "All is well here, "except that we walk all day without knowing where we're going "and no one can remove their boots "but the officers." Must smell good. Gervais never washed anyway. Remember when we pushed him in the pond? "The good thing is we're in reserve, far from the fighting and danger. "There's a good atmosphere with the boys. "We've time to think of you back home "as I know you think of us here. "Kiss Mama for me. "Tell Constance that Bastien thinks of her and the boy. "Warmest wishes, Louis" Don't worry, he'll write. He won't. René! It's the mayor. Morning, Ren. What do you want now? Your two horses. You understand, it's for the war effort. The mare's lame. I can't do anything. Go ahead, gentlemen. How will he cope without his horses? Don't worry, I can help. The shop is doing well. It's not just that. The mare's lame but they took her. - Good morning! - Your son wrote. He's well. What good's a lame horse to them? Can you tell me? That won't win us the war! Don't blame him. He's always been like that. Fonder of his horses than his son? I stroke your thighs... and nibble your breast at the same time. I nibble... - Wait... "Nibble"? - Yes. And nibble them... "Your breasts..." And nibble them... You want to use these words? Yes! I've got such a hard-on, I can't continue! Won't it shock her? No, not at all! That's how we talk together. It's just right, believe me. If you knew what she wrote! But we don't. It'll inspire me. Read it! What? It interests us too. He's keen! So... "Gouvieux, "17th January 1915..." She's writing from Gouvieux. That's her godmother's... So... "I do as I told you, "while thinking of you, each night, "and sometimes in the daytime too." "Thinking of you, it's not a sin "and I don't want to do it with anyone else. "It's your big rod that I like." I'll be damned! "Signed, your little bitch." A girl like that's not possible! I know one, when I squeeze her neck, how she moans! Come off it! You can't make that up. What are you doing? Get moving! - Is Albert with you? - No! What are you doing? Come on! Albert! Gaspard? What are you doing? Come on! - We have to go! - No! Gaspard! - We've no more time! - No! No! He was there! Gaspard... I found him! I found him! Here!... Let's go! Come on! Let's go! - What were you doing? - Looking for Gaspard. - Fucking shrew! - Vole! Sure it is... Move! Shit, it's not ours! It's not ours! - Have you seen the 256th? - No, pal. They were on our right, the Boche in front. If we go that way we'll find them. Hey! Where were you? We got lost. Attention, soldiers! Did you flee from the enemy? Not at all, General. It was because of the autocannon. - We thought a shout was an order. - From who? It was dark. We followed the others and realised... Enough! Deplorable conduct. You're not French soldiers. You're... Scum. Cowards. A disgrace to the country. A danger to the fatherland. General, I know these men. - There's a lack of discipline... - We agree on that! A serious lack. Send them to the barn. At least there's straw. We're in for it now. Yes, you scum. You're scum, a coward. A disgrace to France. How many have died already? 20,000 a day on the Marne. Fucking brass. Please calm down. Calm down... And that ninny! Can't you shut up? We're sick of your vole! - Don't talk to him like that. - I'll do as I like. Don't, he's upset. It's not our fault. We're here because of him. Him, the vole, you. We waited for you. I said he was dangerous. It's true. Go ahead. - May we know... - I can't talk to you. Smells like jail. Well, jail's better than the trenches. In a good old prison, within 2 days I'll have bribed the warders. - Long live jail. - That's right. Time for bed. Lie down and sleep. More lamb, Father? No more thank you, it's excellent. General, I know these men. They fled. They explained their mistake. Did they turn their back on the enemy? - Yes, but... - Did you give the order? - No, General. - Did a lieutenant? An adjutant? A sergeant? Not that I'm aware. They took 5 hours to return to camp. This morning we spoke of discipline at HQ. They'll be shot as an example. At dawn, before the whole regiment. General... That's enough, Captain. You saw Foch's memo regarding desertion of post? - Yes, General. - You contest it? - No, but in this case... - Saint-Charles... You're a good officer defending your men. Fine. But remember 70. Sedan. The routs. The defeat. You think I do this willingly? No, General. Maybe a court martial... would be better placed to assess their accountability? You question my judgement? I wouldn't presume to, General. That's fortunate. Dessert? My poor children. What are we facing? I'm not here to judge men, but to accompany them. Come on, priest. You know me. There are no traitors in God's kingdom if they confess their sins. I'm here to relieve your souls. We've done nothing, Father. If that's the case, he'll welcome you. What's all this mystery? Out with it. He's right. "A lion in the flesh, a lamb in the confessional". No sermons! It'll happen shortly. "France needs examples", is what the General said. The firing squad? Unfortunately. We die like that? No court martial, nothing? With no chance to defend ourselves? We're not cowards. We got lost! We said! - I can't do anything. - You can. No. I don't want to die this way. At least ask that we be sent to the Front. We'd rather be shot by the enemy, marching into battle, even unarmed, than be shot as cowards. Father! I'll sit over here. I'll pray for you and hear those who wish to confess. You add shame to injustice! How can you condone this? We're good soldiers. Call the Captain. He'll stand up for us. He already tried. So who? You see we've been abandoned? I'm here. Not to save us. You've come to harvest souls! My son... Enough! Your soft voice sickens me! - Out! - Hey! I'm a good Christian. - I want to die in peace. - Me too. Absolving innocent men! It's disgusting! - It's their choice. - Shut it! We're not in the certif. See where your morals got us? Stop telling us what to do! You're worse than him. I want to live. Do you find that vulgar? I've money, priest. 1000 francs for you. You call the guards, we surround them, it could work. Dead already, you bunch of dolts. I'd rather a bullet in the back trying to save myself. - Control yourself. - Control myself? I'm about to die and I have to be dignified? All right, I'll confess like everyone. I'll follow your advice, Louis. Tell you a secret to ease my conscience. Your wife. I've been screwing her for 4 years. Regularly. Or rather, "I screwed her". Right, Father? What's the penance for that? You're rotten, Bastien. Rotten beyond belief. Just as I thought. I'd punch a chap who cuckolded me. But not you. You "control yourself". Go ahead and die. Stop! Right shoulder arms! Right! I'd understand. Hail Mary, full of grace, blessed is the fruit of your womb... Fire! Right turn! Sling arms! Squad...! Forward march! Present arms! Quarter turn right. Right! Forward march! I can't go on, Captain. It's too hard. Check the others are dead. Clovis! They're here. There are survivors. - There are 3 of us, Captain. - It's all right, lad. Give me a hand! It's my hip. My hip... Right lung perforated, at least two bullets. Penetrating wound to the heart. Let's take them away. - Boys! Take them away! - Captain, they've no I.D. What do I register them as? Wounded in combat. Let's go. All right, dig a pit for the others. What will they think of me? - You'll tell them? - Yes. Tell them... Driver! Louis? - Back from Hell? - Seems like it. And the others? Clovis died in my arms. Bastien survived, they evacuated him. Good to see you, Louis. Private Louis Dulac, 256th Infantry Regiment, 4th Company. Captain, I was spared by the firing squad. I'm not a coward. I ask to be reinstated and fight for my country. It's the regiment's war diary. Look, your execution was recorded at 5:50. Authorisation was requested from Command... one hour later. You should at least have been court martialled. They were wrong to kill us? The executions were a little... hasty and no one wants anybody to know. Yours, I think. - To your reinstatement. - Thank you, Captain. Captain, may I ask a question? Go ahead. 20 soldiers, 10 metres off target. It's no accident. Who knows? You perhaps. You think a French officer would defy his superiors' orders? Come on, Dulac. Be worthy of this miracle. Stop thinking it's my doing. You'll get me into trouble. Check the hens. There will be an egg. When? My poor girls... I came as soon as I heard. They phoned me earlier to tell me. Both our husbands? Yes. But they didn't die as you think. They were shot as deserters with 4 others, all local boys. I'm telling everyone. You're the first. It's a tragedy for the village. In the middle of a war, with enemy at our door. I didn't expect it of them. Constance the Boche! News travels fast. That's your son, Mayor. Where? I don't see him. Who told them? - I don't know. - Really? I'll be off. Quite right, Mayor. Don't linger with coward's wives. I was prepared for him to die, but not like that. - Who are the others? - Clovis. - And...? - A boy from Andry. Jules something... And the blacksmith's son, Albert. My God, his mother. They can't have turned chicken together. - They're good men. - But they did. Now they'll treat us like dirt. - They shouldn't have. - Stop! - They shouldn't have. - Stop! No, it's no good. No, it's no good. I've money, you won't even be a war widow. How can you think of that now? Mama! That's good! Thank you. Look at him, a mouth to feed. That's how. Fix bayonets. Pass it on! Let's go! Let's go! Stop! Come! Come! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Go! Go! You'll get a mention! - Any water? - Bringing in prisoners under fire! That's hooch, you idiot! Get away! Away! Providence was right to choose you, Dulac. Your courage as a soldier is precious to us. I'm trying to be worthy, Captain. But I keep thinking of them. Knowing they have no grave. I'd like to ask a favour. This church, hear how it echoes with the absence of our soldiers. On these chairs, left empty, your husbands, your children, our brothers are more than ever with us. Their souls protect us. Their sacrifice, and courage honours us. Even if... the weakness of some, has sadly... Albert Mevel. Jules Andieux. Gervais Martin. Clovis Le Bourdet. Bastien Marchandeau. Hello, Mama. My boy! My boy! If I were him, I'd go now. Right away! I always knew our boys were brave. Listen to this, though! Listen! Silence when I speak. Show some respect for the hero. "Private First Class, "Louis Dulac, at the peril of his life, incapacitated "3 of the enemy, and captured 2 others, "whom he brought back despite heavy fire." 3 + 2 = 5. If every soldier does the same, in a month we're in Berlin! Tell him I'm right. If I were Joffre, it's the moment to go! The Boche are weakening! - If you say so. - They must be. You bagged 5! Now you have to finish what you started. Kill them all! My hero. I'll look after you, you'll see. - Are you all right? - Fine. I'm a bit hot. Who'd like some cheese? They need their share of the war, don't they? Which hospital was Bastien taken to? Orleans, I think. Was he badly hurt? He'll write to you. We never had much to talk about. Mind you, that's how he got me. He spoke so well, a real chatterbox. He made my head spin. You never said anything. Business is good, you know. I took on 3 assistants. All old men. Come and see the counter. If this carries on, we'll be able to expand. I'm sorry, I'm tired. It's normal with all this emotion. My hero. Honestly, I never thought... What are you doing? I'm looking. Is that a bullet? Barbed wire. My man... Stop. What if I like your courage? That's enough! You're hurting me. Go on, squeeze. Is that what you want? That's what you want? That's what you want? What's wrong? Lower! Bloody fleas! It's done. Hey, Kaiser, look how handsome we are! Let's see the photo. You know, after the war... Two sous! - We don't talk here... - About the war! Two sous...! - It kills us or ruins us! - Cough up! There you are. Gentlemen, I hereby announce the return of Bastien Marchandeau! Gentlemen! Hello! - You'll never get rid of me! - Go away! We're fine here. Who says I'll spoil things? I've come to soften this bitch of a war! Two sous! No talk of war. It's the rule. Two sous! Pay up! This is for loyalty. Courage... Allegiance to the flag... Patriotism... All the shit that rots our minds as we wait to die. Stop! - You can't stop yourself. - Let's forget the past. Hey, pour me a drink instead. To "Big Rod"! I'm glad to see you again. You won't believe it but me too. I'm too damn healthy. I did everything not to come back. Slept with syphilitic whores, injected my knee with petrol... But I recovered from everything. Fit for service. Long live the war! And drunkenness! Shell! Casualties! Come and see! What happened? - Machine gun. - Where is it? Back there, 300m towards Fritz. Halfway up the slope. It's hidden in the trees, but I saw it fire earlier. The brass don't want artillery. We'll attack it tonight. We'll deal with it, right? - I need 3 volunteers. - Me, Sergeant. With Francis. And...? - A third. - Bastien. Go on. For the 4 friends who can't risk their lives tonight. Go on! Stop, Louis! Enough! Keep digging! Goddamn Devil's brood! I think he's thirsty. Enough. Morning, Father-in-law. Has the doctor been? You'll take it all, won't you? Yes. Why not stay with me, until she recovers? No offence, but there comes a time when you have to rest. We're doing well, with the war. Why don't you move in with me? You think we can't cope on our own? No, it's just an idea. Take your time. Think. Meanwhile, please have this. Take back your money. The cow's in calf. I'll sell it in the spring. Or sell the farm. Your husband doesn't want it. Get back to work! Filthy vermin! What are you looking at? Why are you looking at me that way? All right, that's enough. Come on! Chop-chop, girls. Let's go. This way. See you Tuesday? Keep moving. Is your hut heated? You won't have time to get cold. Go! Did you see what I saw? New arrivals! I'm warning you... They're here for 2 days. They can't do everyone, so you book and pay in advance. Come on, put down your pen, get out your boner! I'm writing to my family. Remember family? Constance, your son... Ring a bell? I'm busy now. Write it for me. Come on, blockheads! Get bonking! To bed! 2 hours since her waters broke. Still not in labour. We're going to lose her, and the calf too. No vet? He died in Champagne. We're cursed. I was a mechanic. We could call the mayor? Why not the priest? What do you want to see? A female suffering? There's nothing to see. Go and... Go away! You're annoying us! Listen, I need to get the legs. Will you help? Together, we can get it out. I was a mechanic. I'll tie the legs while you part the whatsit. You'll tear her! We're about to lose both of them! Get out of here! - What's that? - He wants to help. To kill my calf! - They bring misfortune! - No! No! Not pull... Die! Get him out. He says he's a student. What harm can it do? Calm. I'm translating. No. Fetch us a drink. You kept the cow or calf? Both. Well done. It took the three of us but... And I... Before the war, student. Veterinary. The war stops everything. My father, farm, like this. Little. Thank you. How old are you? How old? - 25. - My son's 27. - I'll pray for your mother. - Enough. Well then... good health. Want to see it? You see, they're not all bad. - Better? - Yes, I'm fine. - Out! - What? Come back when you've paid your debts. - I paid them! - Sure! - Got the cash? - On the nail. Good. So, "Big Rod", - Nearly there? - Will you go away? You like being read but not watched! Hey! - What now? - We've no water to wash. Where do you think you are? You're wasting time. Bastard! All right, I'm going. Changed your mind? Come to dip your nib? I wrote your letter to Constance. Just sign it. I'd rather read it first. "Dear Constance, "I finally decided to write to you. "Since my unfair execution, "I should have used my extra life to serve my country. "I've done the reverse. "I've become hard, greedy, vulgar. I don't eat, I stuff myself. "I steal, treat women like cattle, "and profit from other people's misery." Shall I go on? You write well. You've told Marguerite how you bayonet the enemy with a weird smile? I don't give a shit. Give me that. Turn around. If you want a girl, it's on the house. You see, I'm not all bad. I stink? You bitch! Say that again! Stop! Calm down. - She said I stink! - None of that! - Out! - But I paid! You're a shit stirrer! Me? I'm a whore not a slave! Sure... Get back to work. My arse! Again? Next customer! Move it! Carry on. Everything's all right. Still there? Yes, I paid for two goes. Pathetic bunch of worms! Out of my way! Don't touch me! You stink! Let me through! Let me pass! Officer! Shit! It's over. Scarper! Hold your fire. Get away! Finish off by hand. Get your things. Look after her. It's over. Don't touch me! - Let me get my things. - Get up! Let's go! Let me go! Bastien! Stop! What are you doing? Let me pass. What are you doing? Stop! Let me pass, I said! Calm down! It's not a good idea! I'm angry at him, Dulac. He got a reprieve he didn't deserve. Good men died and he... I've asked to be part of the court martial. You'll be partly to blame. Pardon? Excuse me, Captain. - You defend him? - It's complicated. Explain. Perhaps I'll understand. We grew up together. That's all. I was afraid you wouldn't come. I'm getting turkey and cheese. Will you stay? We've done the condemned man's last night already. I'm spending this one the way I want. Like a lout! No letter to my family, no prayers. Tomorrow, I'll spit in the firing squad's face. War, peace... I'll spit in their faces. It's a luxury we can afford, since we're already dead. To you. You didn't send it? Why not? The trafficking, the hatred, the whores, it's all true. I didn't want to. It's the war. It changes us. We lose our way, don't we? You'll look after Constance and the boy? That's good. My mind's at rest now. And you know what? He spent the night with his calf! I've never seen him so happy! Could you order some more apple trees? Yes, ma'am. - You've taken on more staff? - It's the war! Here... soap, oil, sardines and butter. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Don't mention it to Ren. - Oh, no...! - It's from Louis. You wouldn't disobey Louis? If he says so. Shall I take you home? Jesus, Mary and Joseph! It's beautiful! Get in. - You can drive? - You'll soon see. I could meet the bishop in this! Ren, come and see! Don't go in, Eugenie. What? Let me pass! I don't know why he did it. Deep down, he was proud of you. No, Mama. Your wife I suggested I moved in with her. After the war, we'll all be together. You'll see how pretty your house is. She changed all the furniture. I'd say you've done very well! If you were to give me a grandson... She's kind to me you know. We can leave the shop as it is, because it works well, but we hardly use the warehouse for anything. I've an idea. I'll show you. Look, it's from England. After the war, the men will come back. They'll need tools to rebuild with. We could sell farm equipment... In addition to the seeds. There's money to be made. I know people. I do business in Paris every month. I met someone in the War Ministry. He can do something for us. For us? Get you moved behind the lines. And what would you do for that? Pay him? Sleep with him? What's got into you, Louis? You were made for each other. Do you know why Bastien was shot? He was a thief. A trafficker, a looter. He made money from people's misfortunes. Now I know why you slept together. I just arrived. I know. I wanted to offer my condolences. And for your father. A lot of black... You're a general? Am I a general? Almost. Want to be a general too? Here... My papa was a soldier like you. Mama says he's in heaven, because he killed lots of Boche. Yes, he's in heaven. All right, off to bed. Will you undress me? Yes. All right. Braces.... lift your arms. There... You look like an old hand! Right, you're big enough to finish on your own. I... have to go. Will you come back? Come on. I'll be in soon. Go quickly. Marguerite will be waiting. Seen how nice your house is? You know, Louis... She was the only one not to reject us. Take care of her. She doesn't need anyone. It's lucky. I just left her. Why? A bad marriage. You understand? There... it took all that for me to take your hand. A war. That's a lot. I'm going back to the Front. If I survive, I'd like to take care of you. You and the boy. Yes. Captain! Albert. Albert Mevel. Little Mevel. We couldn't save them all. You understand. I know. Adaptation: Clare McAllister
