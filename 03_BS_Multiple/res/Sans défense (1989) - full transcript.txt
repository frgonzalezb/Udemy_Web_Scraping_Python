When? - Next week. - No problem. Who are you going with? - Well, I'd like to go with Baptiste. - All right. - OK. Laurent, close the door behind me. I'm going to start the car. Good morning. - Hi Laurent! Here, I have something for your grandfather. - Ah, thank you. - Are you going to see him for lunch? - Yes, yes. - Don't forget to give it to him. - OK. - Right, that's fine. - OK, bye. I've got to go. He wouldn't understand me not going with him. You know what I mean. Bye. - See you later. - You didn't have to bother, you know. - No, I was just passing anyway. But maybe I'm bothering you? - You're silly. - You're silly. - Come on, hello anyway. Ah! What's this? Ah! Mario gave that to you for me? - I have to get the bus at 2 o'clock. - Yes. WEDNESDAY MAY 17 13:45 Hey, come here! Police! What's happening? No! No! WEDNESDAY MAY 17 18:00 Do you want something to drink? - Yes, give me a pastis. You see? The boy doesn't listen to us, does he? I don't like it! I'm going to talk to Christiane about it. I don't like him being late. If I'd done that my parents would've kicked me out. - I agree with you that he's taking advantage. But even so— he'll be fourteen soon and these days he's no longer a child. - You can be sure he won't see that moped for his 14th birthday. Definitely not! - Did you really promise him a moped for his birthday? - Didn't he tell us he had a maths test today? - Yes. There, that'll be him. - That's no reason to drown it. - Well? are you going to open the door for him or do I have to do it? - Mireille, we're not his servants. It wasn't Laurent at the door. Now repeat what you just told me. - I came to see if Laurent was ill. - Go on, say it. - Well, that's it. Since he wasn't there in the afternoon, I brought him the homework set by the English teacher. - What? You mean he wasn't there the whole afternoon? And not this morning either? - No no, I picked him up at noon. He had lunch here. - Yes, that's true, I'm stupid. - Do you know the girl he was talking to at noon? - No, I have lunch in the canteen. I don't know who he was talking to. - If the little bastard's done this to us on purpose, you'll see— - What's he done to us? - Can I go? - Don't worry, Jules, he can't have gone far. Montpellier isn't Paris. - Yeah, all right. - What are you doing? - Calling the school. - Maybe call Christiane first? - She'll know soon enough. - Yes, thanks, goodbye. I don't know what to tell you. We've asked around all his classmates. About the young girl you were interested in, Mademoiselle Leroy. No, seriously— Unless you're not telling me everything. Not everything? What d'you mean not everything? - What, what. Exactly, I don't know. - Out with it, come on! Tell me. - A child who runs away— always has an immediate reason. But it's linked to an underlying condition At the end of the day it's— it's the single drop of water that overflows the vase. You understand? And so you have a runaway. Maybe there were arguments? Punishments he resented? I don't know— Resented? What are you talking about? - Precisely. Maybe you—you're aware of it. - Oh, thank you! Thank you! 30,000 children go missing every year. Most of them come back home within 24 hours. Others after 48 hours. And those who only return after a fortnight, or those found before, these are exceptions. - Monsieur, I'm not asking you to reassure me, I'm asking you to listen to me! Aside from all that, come on, let me finish! So my Italian friend, Mario is a driver on the bus route my grandson uses to go to school. And I'm trying to tell you that at ten to two, he saw my grandson, Laurent, at the stop on Rue des Lauriers. He was driving the bus, and he saw the stop and Laurent. - Alone? - Alone, yes, he was going to school. And that's when a BMV— - You mean a BMW? It doesn't matter. Carry on, carry on. - So this car, black or blue, he's not sure, was registered in Paris, 75. He's sure of that. So the car overtook the bus, you see? It overtook the bus, it moved in front. - Yes. And it approached Laurent who was at the bus stop. There were people inside. So they opened the door to show him something and he got in. - Into the car? - Yes. Then it drove off. And then nothing. So Mario says it didn't look like a real kidnapping, because he wasn't forced to get in. He wasn't forced to get in, you understand? - All right, well, listen. We're going to take your statement. By the way, does the child have parents? Mr. Rampin, are you feeling all right? - I'm tired. Exhausted. I'll be fine. It's my daughter, Christiane. She's a widow, because she had— she had a terrible accident three years ago. But she held herself together. She's a strong woman, as you'll see. But she's only holding on because— because of the boy, you understand? - You're not doing well, are you, isn't that so? Right, listen. For now we'll talk about a runaway. And well—you shouldn't always think negatively, should you. - What's going on? What are you doing here, Dad? - Ah, hello Madame, are you Laurent's mother? - This is my daughter. - Someone called me. Where's Laurent? - Well, Laurent—ran away. He didn't go—he didn't go to school. He didn't go to school. - What do you mean? - It happens, you know, a lot more often than you think. - The Commissioner here was explaining to me, that all in all, there are at least 30,000 runaway children a year. - Mr. Rampin, we need to question the bus driver. The one who witnessed your grandson's abduction. - What does that mean? - Don't worry Madame. We'll find him. Give us all the details. Even those that seem insignificant to you. Do not hesitate to call me, even at night. Here, here's my number. My personal phone. And anyway, my assistant is on duty at night, he'll do whatever is necessary. - Thank you. - I know it's hard. Yes. Get some rest. He's most probably a runaway. Anyway, the description of the individual, as well as that of his vehicle, has been sent to all our police and to the border force. We'll catch him, you can be sure of that. So. - Thank you, thank you very much. Don't worry honey, I'll take care of it. - Do you have a cloth? - I'll mop it up. Does anyone want anything to eat? What about you, aren't you hungry? - I wanted to do the same as you just now, I tried to eat a biscuit. It just weighed on my stomach. - Fucking shit! Who? Who? Who? We don't have any money. They can't be doing this for ransom. I suppose we could sell Grandma's house. But what good would that be? You didn't tell him off this morning, did you? - Absolutely not. He was the same as usual. - And of course you know, he's not—he's not a thug. He's a good boy. - I'll be back. I'm going to see Mireille. Do you need anything? Jules' explanations can be so confused at times. Basically, what did he really tell the commissioner? Apart from looking for that car. It's true they can't say much. Except that they're continuing the search. He thinks maybe we're going to get a phone call. - What if it was my brother? - But Mimi, you know very well it can't be the Pichons. Their maid told us they were out for dinner. They aren't here, they're in Paris. - Yes, but who else has a Paris registration, I really don't see who it could be. Here, give me the sheet please. Are you sure you don't know anyone else in Paris? - What if it was people from here with a hired car? - Yes, you're right. But—I can't see who. - Me neither. Do you remember when you were so worried about your job? We got that right, didn't we? I see two bad men with him. Ah yes but, there's a very good man too. - Maybe that's Dad. Look, the Devil. - That's sexuality. - No Mum, not that. No, the police are positive. It's not about a few men in a car. - I see Laurent beside water. I'm sure that's where he is. - Good God, what the fuck was he thinking, getting into that car? Allo? Yes? No, it doesn't matter. No, it's Mimi's brother. No, the boy's run away, so we just wondered if he'd tried to contact you, that's all. No, no, Mireille's lying down, she'll call you tomorrow. All right, all right, I'll let you know. That's OK. - Well? - Well then, he must have slept over with a friend we don't know, that's all. No, don't upset yourself like that. Don't worry, my darling, don't worry. No need to worry like that. One metre 60. What was he wearing? Brown hair. Jeans. Wait, I can't remember. Oh yes, he was wearing a T-shirt and trainers. Yes that's right, he has brownish-green eyes. There's been an accident. - Tell me everything. Are you sure it's him? What d'you mean, you don't know anything? You haven't identified him? Of course he didn't have an ID card! Have you ever seen a kid his age carrying an ID card? Well? I'm sorry. I know this is hard. But I've just heard there was another child who didn't return home. Whoever this one is was involved in a traffic accident on a bike. - Laurent doesn't ride a bike. Where did he get a bike? - Madame— This other child we've been told about didn't have one either. - I'm ready. Where's the body? No, I'll do it. No! It isn't Laurent! It isn't Laurent! Strange disappearance of a schoolboy in Montpellier. Anyone who can provide information about this child, should call the following number: 16 1 32 12 46. "Abductiion of a young boy from Montpellier" We're hearing that a young boy has run away or disappeared in the Montpellier area. The boy was on his way to school at 2 pm as usual ... I didn't think we'd make it. It's five to ten. - It's Christiane who concerns me. - Don't worry, Ninou. Christiane's more resilient than you think. Are you sure this is the right platform? - We'll find him, Mimi. You know we'll find him. - You're so stubborn. Why do you want to go off to Paris when I'm sure he's around here? By the sea. In a house by the sea. Besides, you haven't been in Paris for a long time. Are you at least going to see my brother? - Yes. Look, we both talked about it. This isn't the place or the time. - Monsieur Rampin! Monsieur Rampin. - Yes? - Monsieur Rampin. Yes? - I couldn't get here earlier. Here. This is the address of a colleague of mine. He knows how and where to find Laurent. - I'm very grateful. - Don't miss it! - Is that true? - He called me this morning. - That's great! Hear that, Jules? Great! Bye. Goodbye, thanks. - Just bring him back to us! I had your daughter on the phone. She told me you'd be at the station. But I had a strange sensation. Isn't she ill? - Christiane? She's not my daughter, she's my husband's daughter, but that's OK. - Oh, I didn't know. Good evening. - Good evening. Where are you going? - Hang on, I'll tell you. Rue Cognacq-Jay. - Rue Cognacq-Jay, where the TV is? - It's possible. - It's not possible, it's certain, yeah. I know the TV very well, you know. In fact not even a month ago, I had Patrick Sabatier sitting right where you are. With his wife by the way. She's incredibly nice. Cute as a button. - Yeah, yeah— - Just really down to earth. The guy's really cool. She's not snobby at all. You can't say that for everyone. Look, about six weeks ago, just where you're sitting, I had an American, an actor, for Antenne 2 by the way. Faranegger, a super beefy guy who shoots faster than his shadow in the movies. A really cool dude, down to earth. On the other hand, that can't be said for everyone. Some can be real arseholes! FRENCH TELEVISION TF1 Alfred Lelluch Center Monsieur? - Ah yes, here we are, I'm expected by Monsieur— Wait, I have his name here. Yes, I have to see Monsieur Fred Stéphane. - Fred Stéphane, yes. Who are you? - What d'you mean who am I? - Your name? - Oh, sorry, I'm Mr. Rampin. Jules Rampin. - One moment please. I have M Rampin at reception for M Stéphane. Does he have an appointment? - Do you have an appointment, Monsieur? - No, but I was sent by his colleague from Montpellier. His colleague from the newspaper Le Midi Libre. - The gentleman is from the newspaper Le Midi Libre. - No. On behalf of a colleague of Mr. Stéphane who works at Le Midi Libre. - I'm sorry Monsieur, but I'm afraid Mr. Stéphane can't see you today. You need to call him back tomorrow morning. - No, are you sure about tomorrow? What about tonight? - I can't tell you anything else. His assistant told me you should call him tomorrow morning. - No, he knows who my grandson is. He said he'd found my grandson, you understand? - Yes, of course, but there's nothing else I can tell you, Monsieur. - Leave him a message because— he—well, he called me. He said that— Phone call for Mademoiselle Micka. Oh, Mademoiselle. - Madame. Do you need a room? - Yes. - For how long? - One night. Maybe more. I don't know yet. - It's all right, you pay every morning here. It'll be 86 francs. Room number 6. First floor. - Thank you, thank you. - You're welcome. Basically it's convenient. There's no phone. So I'm writing to you. And who knows— I may be home before my letter. Mr. Fred Stéphane, please. No, no Monsieur, I'll call you back in an hour. Thanks. - That's four calls, yes? - I'll take your word for it. Yes? Mr. Rampin? Yes, he's here, I'll put you through. - Yes? - Mr. Stéphane. I'm Jules Rampin. Where's Laurent? Where's my grandson? - OK, calm down Mr. Rampin. - But where is he? - Please Mr. Rampin, it's not that simple. - What? What d'you mean, it's not that simple? - Listen, Mr. Rampin, let me make a suggestion. I'll meet you tonight at the restaurant. Is that OK for you? - No sooner? - No, I can't. I'm sorry, I can't. - Where? - I don't know, let's say at the Louis XIII restaurant. - The Louis XIII restaurant, fine. I'll find it. What time? - Let's say around 8. Well, I'll be there, but I don't know how— how will I recognize you? - I'll have a raincoat. - You'll have a raincoat— - A blue jacket and a bow tie. - Good, that's great, great. Right, good bye. Mr. Rampin? Fred Stéphane. Pleased to meet you. No, no, please sit next to me. - So can you really help me find my grandson? - I wish that with all my heart. Listen Mr. Rampin, there are a few things I must explain to you first. I'm afraid my colleague in Montpellier didn't give you the whole picture. - You mean he lied to us? - I don't think you should take it that way. Look at this. Do you know what this is? It's a Minitel code. You can use this to contact young boys who prostitute themselves. Some for fun, most for money. Because they've been conditioned to do this. And they have no other choice. Listen Mr. Rampin, I'm going to be completely up front with you. We need each other. You want to find Laurent? There's a good chance he's fallen into the hands of a ring of this kind. For my part, what I want is to expose this filth. The documentary I'm producing will be a wake-up call, and you'll be the witness. I want thousands of viewers to understand the horror and hypocrisy of the world— we're evolving in, right to the end! Until we find Laurent. You follow me? - Yes but where? - With your permission, I want to film the reunion of grandfather and grandson. - Film it for the whole world to see? If you want, but not Laurent, not his name, not his face. - All right. - Well, in that case, yes. - I need your written permission. Just sign here. - All right, now what do I do? - Keep your eyes and ears open. We're already hard at work. You see my raincoat and my bag? No, be discreet. In my bag, there's a miniature video camera. It takes great videos. I've turned it on. Casually, glance at the two kids at the table over there. See the one facing us? He noticed us watching him. He won't take long to give us a signal. - A signal for what? - Be quiet, let me handle it. Above all, don't say anything. The phone number where you can leave a message ... - Here we go. He told me his price. - How could you? - But what do you expect? You're going to find Laurent by questioning priests? Can you see a kid that age who could help us? - Yes, Yes. We'll never find him around here. Listen, we've done all the clubs, all the bars for two weeks. You'll only find him on the street. If not, he isn't in Paris. He's in another city. - This is not okay! You're kidding, shit! Fuck it! Arseholes! You don't like my face? You, give me that. It's mine, give it to me! Oh let me go! Arsehole! Don't touch! Arsehole! Let me go! - My card! You've got it! - You'll see. Yeah, Stéphane speaking. What? No but—this isn't a joke? No, I'm fucking dreaming! It's fantastic! Ah! Great! Yeah OK. Thanks. He found Laurent? - What are you talking about? - About grandpa Jules. Wasn't that him on the phone? - No, it has nothing to do with grandpa Jules Rampin. It was the boss himself calling. We're leaving. You know where? We're going to see the Pygmies! Three months I've waited for him to send us there, to Africa. - Hopefully they won't have slaughtered them all before we get there. And him? - What about him? - Well—what are you going to do about him? - What do you want me to do about him? I've been lugging grandpa around the fag clubs for three weeks. After all, it's not my fault we haven't found his grandson. He shouldn't dream. - So what are you going to do about grandpa Rampin? Allo Mademoiselle. I have nothing against you—please understand that. My little Laurent. We were on his trail. - It's Mr. Rampin. - No no. - Please put him on the phone. - No, he's not here. He left to make a film on the extermination of the Pygmies. - I'm sure—I'm sure he's there, so put him on the phone. Please put him on the phone, please. No, please Mademoiselle, I beg you, put him on the phone. I'm sorry, goodbye Mr. Rampin. My dear ones. I hope your morale isn't too low. At my end, I'm searching all possible places. But so far without result. If I could get a helping hand from the deputy or the prefect, that would open doors for me in Paris. And if you have any news from the commissioner, let me know. Good evening. - Good evening. - Still drinking Perrier? - No no, give me a Cognac. A Camus Napoleon? - Yes. - Have you left the man with the raincoat in the cloakroom for us? - No, I'm looking for someone. You can help me. Look—here you are. Keep the change. All of it. - Minou, I've told you already not to whistle like that, it's scary. - There's nothing pretty here, my friend. Believe me, they're unreliable. What are you looking for? - A young boy, about fourteen. 1 metre 60, with a Midi accent. - Well, old man, you can have your change, this is not that kind of place. - No, not at all, you don't understand. I'm looking for my grandson. My grandson. - 200, 300 and 500. I don't know anything about minors and I don't want to know. - No but—help me. Please help me. - But how do I know you and your friend aren't cops? If I play nice, if I try to help you, then I'll get arrested. Thank you, I've been there. - I'm sure you know something! Where's my grandson! I'm sure you've seen him! In here, once! A Midi accent! You have to help me! I'll smash your face if you don't tell me! - There are no kids here! - Yes there are. I've seen them. This isn't over, you motherfuckers! - Leave him alone. You won't get anything that way. - It was him started attacking us. - Come on, come and sit down. - What do you want from me? - Calm down. - Bitch! - Poor guy! - What do you want? - To see if I can help you. Make myself useful. - Who are you? - My name is Raynald. - You said you wanted to help me. Why? - I couldn't help overhearing that you were looking for your grandson. - But everyone in here heard that. Everyone heard it. - Why here? - I only know about two months ago— that my grandson was abducted, so I'm looking everywhere. Only yesterday— I found out the police were convinced— he'd been taken by a prostitution ring. It seems that, even though they know, they're pretending not to. - What's his name? - Laurent, his name is Laurent. Laurent Gantelme. I'm Jules Rampin, I'm his grandfather. I would do anything to bring him home. Everything, you know? Everything, everything. - What's he like? I mean physically. - He's quite tall, he has a sweet face. He's nearly fourteen. No wait—he's fourteen now. And he has our local accent because— We're from Montpellier. At least, we're close. Close to Montpellier. So the same thing. He's 1 metre 60 tall. Of course he's growing—growing every day. - I'd very much like to help you, you know. - Could you? I'm alone here. I don't know anyone. So all the doors are closed for me, you know? You can't imagine what it's like. You're at home here, same as I am in Montpellier, but people here— you know. Help, help me Monsieur. Please help me. Help me. - Is there a phone I can reach you on? - I've written my number on a piece of paper. Here. - Thanks. I'm really sorry about your jacket. I'll see what I can do for you. If Mimi could see me. Mademoiselle. This—this is for you. So you won't forget me. - Oh no, if you want me to remember you because you're leaving, I'd have preferred flowers. Money I see all the time, but flowers— you might say they're more unusual. - Yes, but I'm not leaving. It's just I'm expecting a very important phone call. The truth is I'd like you to inform me in my room. Seriously, it's very important. I'm waiting for a call but I don't know when— Look, take this back. Go and buy me some flowers. And I'll transfer you go a room with a phone. Yes, allo? Ah yes, it's me, Mimi. Yes? Direct to the room, yes. I have a phone now. They changed my room. No then listen to me, Mimi. Chris— you can tell me about Christiane later, OK? Everyone must do what they have to do. You there, me here. So look, with the information I left you, I'd like you to transfer the savings from the Caisse d'Epargne into my account, the new bank account I opened in Paris. MONTH OF SEPTEMBER... The official investigation is suspended in the absence of new clues. RTL 10 o'clock. Several weeks on we still have no news of the missing child in Montpellier. On site, our correspondent Claude... Allo, yes? Yes it's me. Ah! Are you sure it's him? And the accent? Yes, the accent. Is he at your house? Could you—has he said anything? Good! On my way. Yes. He's fallen asleep. I think he's still drugged. Come on. Come with me. Mr. Rampin, I think we have to be careful not to get too emotional. Because I'm not sure it's really your little Laurent. - He didn't tell you his name? - But I told you on the phone. No, he didn't want to tell me his name or where he's from. On the other hand, he does have a Midi accent. - I'm sure it's him. - Look, I don't want to discourage you but, you know— - No. Tell me where he is. - He's in here, please. Laurent? Laurent? It's Jules. - Come and sit down. Make yourself comfortable. I'll get you something to drink. - I believed it! I believed it! - And we can't stop believing, especially now. Take this. Besides, we might learn something from him. Yes. Because the truth is, basically, I met this kid by chance. Maybe Providence has put him in our path. No? Who knows, maybe this will lead us to Laurent. Anyway, that's what I think. - It's hard at first. And then you get used to it, because you get used to everything. How old are you? - Almost fifteen. To tell you the truth, today, I'm free. But like Laurent, the men ambushed me when I was thirteen. I got into their car because they said they were police. They had a card, I didn't hesitate. And only then they drugged me. Now I'm free to take drugs or not. - What? What do you mean by free? - Inevitably, one day or another, we get out of it. Because they think you're trapped. You can't do anything else. And you need stuff too. - What stuff? - Why do you want to hurt yourself, Monsieur? I can imagine Laurent, I have the right, but not you. - You're fifteen years old. You have parents. - When I see you, when I listen to you, now, I realize I was right not to try to call them. They wouldn't understand. Can you see me going back to school? Can you see me saying to my mother "Mum, I'm not going to school this afternoon "because I have to turn a trick to buy some shit"? Can you see that? "But Mum, I do it because I need my fix". Fuck this, give me my money, I'm leaving. And call me a taxi. - Here's your money. Go on, you'll find a taxi downstairs. - Anyway, for me—it's screwed. - Go on, off you go! You know, Jules— if I'd had a father like you, I'd never have blamed him for anything. - Really? At times I feel I'm no longer good for anything. Without you, I don't know what I'd do. - What can I tell you— You came into my life ten days ago. By helping you, I helped myself. I can't stand loneliness. Or at least— I thought I couldn't stand it. I told myself lots of stories that cost me dear. There was a boy living here. José. Not a very savoury character. He left me the day— I refused to give him any more money. In short, it was this harpsichord that saved me. I didn't want to see it. You see, the tragedy is that this boy had infiltrated my life. Like a disease, like a drug. The kind of environment I live in impregnates us, despite ourselves. But you, Jules, you have, without knowing it, helped me to realize this. So of course it's— it's a turning point in my life. Your presence has given me wings, Jules. Well, I'd like something to drink too now. - I must phone my wife because I haven't called her since I left the hotel. And she must be worried. - I know who's at the door. I must ask you a favour. Leave me alone for a while. There's something important I have to do. Something I could never have done without you. Do you mind going out for fifteen minutes? - No, of course not. But, could you point me to clubs for homosexuals? Thanks Jules. You want something to drink? - A Coke. Darling. Hello bunny. - Move on uncle, fuck off! Outta here! Can't you see you're pissing us off? Raynald? Allo, 16th arrondissement police, I'm listening. - Allo. - Allo, yes? - Allo, police? - Yes, yes. - Yes, listen, someone's tried to murder Monsieur Raynald. - What's the address? - The street—Avenue Henri-Martin. Number 52. Can you come? Can you be quick? Please hurry. Yes we'll come. Don't move, we're on our way. Raynald? Whiskey. Jules. My God, what happened to you? What happened? Are you ill? - How long have you been here? - We wondered what had become of you. Christiane is very brave, you know. What did you do? Why won't you answer me? And look at the state of you. You're drinking? - Yes— If you don't want to talk to me now, that's fine. Oh, my Ninou. What did they do to you? I tried to call you yesterday. Yesterday evening. I took a room at the hotel, to wait for you. All right, you're going to rest and we're going to get some sleep. And afterwards—afterwards, I called my brother, he's going to help us. If only you knew how badly I slept without the crook of your shoulder. - You know, Mimi, There are no—there are no adults. There are no children. That's how it is. - Now this is a good one. I kept it aside for dessert. Here Jules, taste this. Come on. Well? What do you think? Not bad. Ah, damn it, there's always a good pitcher at the Pichons! I think I have something about Laurent. Seriously, we'll talk about it later. After lunch. The Minitel. And now, the plum brandy! Is that the one the Sangrains brought us from Agen? - Yes! - Yes, it's good. I can't drink it, I can't stand it. But of course it's really good. - Ah yes, this one is the real stuff. - Jules. - The man has suffered. We should make allowances. We don't blame him. Are you going to stay here now? - That's very nice thank you. - It's the least we can do, you know. Especially since your husband is not our age. If I may say so. So for 4,000 francs, what letter? - I'll have an R. One R. Only one. The passive young man will meet the generous man in the Trocadéro gardens. Excuse me Monsieur, no, this can't go on! It can't go on at all! Do you know how much Minitel calls cost? Have you any idea? Two weeks! What is it you're looking for after all this time? We really want to help you, but this is too much, okay? At the end of the day, I'm your brother-in-law, I know that. But even so, this is too much! Oh good evening. - Good evening. - You're the passive young guy, I'm the generous man, yeah? - Yes. - I thought you'd be younger, but that's OK. - 100 for an hour, 300 for the evening. I'm warning you, I won't go to your house. Sure you got the money? Otherwise it's 50 for a blowjob. - Oh, you're wrong, my child. Do you have anyone to take care of you? - How the fuck is that your business? - No, listen. The 100, as you say, yeah, I've got it, but not for what you think. - Oh yeah? - Listen to me first. The money's yours if you'll help me. Here. I'm looking for my grandson. - I don't like to get too involved, but if I help you, it's 200. - OK, only if your information is of use to me. - 200, nothing less! - Yes yes. Here. - Come on guys, let's fuck this fag over. - We'll give him hell, there's enough of us. - I'm gonna tear his head off! - Bastard! - Watch out, the cops! Swine! Trash! Old faggot! You're after little boys, are you starving? Right, you piece of shit? Arsehole! - It's true, Mister Policeman, you've locked us up with an old faggot. Do something, get us out of here. We're not faggots, we're men. - See what I mean? What happened is outrageous. I'm ashamed. - If they'd hit me any harder, I'd be in the newspaper. They'd have been interested in my injuries. No, it's all about half measures. The police are halfway concerned, the press is halfway interested. Thugs half-killing people instead of going all the way. Unfortunately, we live in a lukewarm world. I'm not saying this about you, you seem so nice. But supposedly nice people, I've met so many, I'm even sick of them, I can tell you. I'm not saying this about you. OK, now you know my story. Can I go now? - Mr. Rampin, what convinced you Laurent was kidnapped by a prostitution ring? I agree with my colleagues in Montpellier that there's little chance— we're dealing with a pervert or some affair of the heart. But we're also confronted with the problem of certain sects— - No, Inspector, at the beginning I tried to think logically too. Believe me, it's useless. If we approach certain places, if my heart beats faster, I feel Laurent is not far away. Inspector, my heart is like a pendulum. Thank you. Thank you anyway. What a pity this investigation is not in your hands. You would do better. Good bye. Bye. - What are you doing here? Don't you know your family's looking for you? Mr. Rampin, can you see me? Mr. Rampin, you should go home, or at least call them. - What for? - You looked so determined when you left me earlier. - I was tired, so I sat down. Sometimes I have blackouts. Funny, isn't it? I think my Dad got those too. When I was little, when I saw him, it scared me. - They certainly worked you over didn't they? - All right, let's go. Bye. A great opportunity. Probably the best chance of the match. Oh it's you! Are you trying to kill us all? What the hell have we done to you for God's sake? What have we ever done to you? Didn't we welcome you kindly? Mireille is in such a state! As for your daughter, Christiane, well— - Well what? - Monster! - You want to kill us all? Is that what you want? Christiane can't take any more, she's going crazy. And I'm going crazy too with all this. - Listen Mireille— - Have you seen your face? - Have you seen it? - Yes. - It's horrible. Horrible! Horrible! Just look what you've done to us! Look! I'm going back to Montpellier. Either you come with me now, or don't bother coming ever again. Hear me? Ever! You're crazy, Jules. Completely crazy! Christiane— She's been— - Mireille. - There's no more Mireille, there's no more Mimi. It's over! - Mireille! - Allo? What? Who? Yes, yes. And now it's the police. That's all we needed. I hope this time they'll— Allo? Florence? Florence who? I don't know any Florence. Florence. You make me think of flowers. - Monsieur Rampin. Are you sure you're going to be OK? I'm not saying we can put it off, but you absolutely have to be in good shape. Nobody but you can go there. I'm already taking a very big risk and as far as I'm concerned, that's my business. But this informant can not be compromised for no reason. You understand me? - I don't know what's going on in my life. I just don't know. All right, I accept. - You're to meet this person the day after tomorrow. - Cheers. - Do you understand me correctly? The informant is someone important. He must not suspect for a second. If you find Laurent, he'll be toast, of course. But if you can't find him, there can't be the slightest mistake. I have no authority to do this. Do we have an agreement? - I think this is my last chance. Isn't it? Well? Tell me, am I crazy? You're an exceptional man, Mr. Rampin. Good morning. You have to be ready for noon tomorrow. I have booked your hotel room for you. I hope you won't need it for more than a day or two. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 makes 40. Thanks. - Thank you. Good bye, Monsieur. - You're going to adopt the style of a gentleman. that's what will suit you best. You need money for it. Are you sure you want to? - That goes without saying! - I'm still hesitant. - Not me. - Can you do the hem for tonight? - For tonight, there's absolutely no problem, Madame. - For me— The shoes are a bit tight. I hate to have pain in my feet. - Monsieur, we've never seen anyone suffer in those shoes. - If Monsieur says so. That's good, isn't it? - Well? Mr. Verneuil, please. - Mr. Verneuil is just on his way down, Madame. - Thanks. You're perfect. - You think so? Yes. - Luxury's a serious matter. Confusing. Do we have a meeting at noon? - Yes. - I'd like just to run it through once more. - Can't you do that on the way? Do you have a car? - Yes why? - One thing I would like to do. I don't think it'll be possible afterwards. Would you mind coming with me? Are you feeling better? Everything will be fine now. OK? Everything will be fine. - Madame, it is an honour to welcome so much grace within these venerable walls. Monsieur. - Monsieur Verneuil, Monsieur de Vouvreuil. - Monsieur Verneuil, Monsieur de Vouvreuil? We are from the V clan. So we'll have some affinity, won't we? Certainly in spirit if not the letter. I'm obliged to you, Monsieur. Since our friend was kind enough to entrust me with your status. - Thank you. - Don't thank me yet. I'm afraid my meeting is about to resume, Madame. Please allow me to take my leave. My friend, I'll pick you up at your hotel, shall we say about eight? - Yes. - That's perfect. Good. I've waited long enough for France not to be able to make her wait in my turn. Mademoiselle. Monsieur, my respects. HQ for Florence. - Yes? - Can you see them? - Yes, we're catching up with them. They've come to a large house. We'll continue on foot. What do you want us to do? - In the event of an incident, you see those drivers? We know they're bodyguards. We won't be able to intervene. - I told you. If he finds his grandson, I'll take this all the way. I warned you. You accepted it. I admire your calm. It's true that you're only a fan of young French boys. You're wrong, believe me. These two little Arabs are much more interesting. And I think they're very talented. The little French boys are vulgar in comparison. They don't have the sense of love and happiness like those. Look at them, they love each other. It's a shared happiness. They're happy children, much healthier, natural. Ah, here is our host. I hope he found what you were looking for. I'll leave you to it. - My dear friend, I think I have something to please you. Expensive, but worth the price. If you'll permit the expression. In the age range that interests you, 13, 14, I have plenty tonight. You're going to enjoy him, he's very cute, very docile. And above all, he has never been used. He's waiting for you in the pink and black room. I didn't want to scare him by bringing him downstairs. That'll be 20,000. - It's disgusting! - Disgusting, yes. - We really do have a strange job. When I think that later, at 6 am, we're going to raid a thug's hideout suspected of trafficking in videotapes. Is that really a crime? I'm cold. Poor kid. What—what's your name? - They haven't given me a name yet. - Have you met a boy, his name is Laurent? He's about the same age as you. - I don't remember. I don't know. I don't remember. The darkness, the injections. - Listen, wake up anyway. I'm asking you a question. Have you always been like this? Well? Hey? Do you have parents? Where do you come from? Do you have a mother? Do you have a grandfather? - I don't remember! I don't remember. This way. - He's yours for the whole night, you know? I hate you. I hate you. Monsieur Rampin? Monsieur Rampin? Are you okay? Are you injured? - I killed him! - Let me see! - I killed him! It's my fault! - You, help me. - It's my fault! It's my fault, I killed him. I killed him, it's my fault. - What happened? - I killed him! - But what happened? All right, so what do we do now? - My place. This is Bordier. - Yes, Commissioner? Go to 55 rue des Ecluses, near the Canal Saint-Martin. We're going to raid the video traffickers. According to the neighbours, there are lots of children held in the basement. It's your last chance to find the old man's kid. You're not in too much pain? - Oh no. - Here we are. Commissioner Bordier will give the signal. Flo has a lot of intuition. She's a good inspector. - Don't worry, you two. When there's no more hope, failure can't hurt. - You have no right to say that. - I like you both, but tonight— I have acquired the right to say what I know. We found three kids in the basement. - He said three. Grandpa Jules? - Yes my darling, yes, everything's all right now. Everything's all right. Everything's fine. My boy! Grandpa, you have no idea. Mum? Mum. Mum. 30,000 child runaways are registered in France every year... and 7,000 children under 20 prostitute themselves in Paris. English subtitles by jeremys and Marseilles TNT 2023
