Soobesükütsa tüa pia mupitsl ikÜ kimai. A long time ago, it is said, a monster came here. A white tail. Sarii. Mahoinitü. I remember when Father told me I was ready for kühtaamia. My big hunt. You were little. So, Mother took you to gather medicine. But Father and I, we went up into the hills. The rain was bad. Everything was wet. We crawled through the mud and my bowstring… …got ruined and... You were sleeping. I was waiting for it to circle back. Now you're gonna have to cross the river to get it. Whoa. Don't get your bowstring wet. Ta a be, this morning in the sky, I saw a sign. The thunder bird. I've been practicing. It's time. I'm ready for my kühtaamia. You really think you're ready? You wanna hunt something that's hunting you? Petsü. - Trained him well. - It's easy. He's smart. Not every smart creature is easy to train. - Is that for War Chief's bad knee? - Mmm. He's getting worse. You didn't put orange totsiyaa. Who taught you about orange totsiyaa? You. Hmm. Your father left you that to cut bread root with. I almost got a deer with it. Yeah. Well, we can't eat "almost." My girl, you are good at so many other things. Why do you want to hunt? Because you all think that I can't. Ah! In this wind, he brings home a red-tail. You should have listened to my story. Didn't think we had time for a nap. Posa. It's sharp enough. Go get us some orange totsiyaa. It see. - Hina? - A lion. It took Puhi. We gotta find him. You could get shot sneaking up like that. Who's sneaking? Who invited you? We won't be gone long enough to need a cook. She should stay. She tracks well. And if we find Puhi alive, she knows medicine. You have to find that cat now. - I will. - I know. 'Cause you have to. Oh, good. The dog found shit. - We're not looking for wolves. - It's not wolf. You see that crushed bone? That's lion scat. And the cat that made it was big. He's breathing. Petsü. So much could kill him. It won't kill him. Just cool his blood. Anaa. Anaa. Ta a be wants to stay and hunt. Let's go. - I'm coming with you. - I can handle the lion. No, it's not just the lion. Why is Puhi alive? There's something that scared the cat away from its den. I've got this. Stay with Puhi. He needs your help too. We don't have time to waste talking. We need to get him home. ManamÜsohi. Üts'tü nü. Tobo'ihupitü. Kee. The cold is good. The medicine slows his blood. If he gets warm, he'll bleed out. Hey. Do you want him to be comfortable or alive? Mia. We don't have time to wait for you. - Look. - Could be bear tracks. Maybe. But that's a big bear. And why was it on its hind legs? And what skins a snake like that? - We need to keep moving. - No. I have to warn my brother. Paaka, go with her. Naru, we don't need the torches. They'll scare the cat. We're in its hunting grounds. Why'd you come back? I found tracks, and they were huge. I'm not frightened by a bear. I don't think it was a bear. I don't know what it was. I've never seen anything like it. It skinned and gutted a snake. Well, whatever it was, we're in the cat's den now. We have to deal with it first. Come on. The lion won't think that we're hunting it here. It'll think it's hunting us. We get some bait, then climb up and wait for it. A hunter doesn't wait. He hunts. We could be here all night. We could stalk the forest all night and not find anything too. If you're too afraid to hunt, go back to camp where you belong. We'll try it Naru's way. We'll bait it, then I'll lead the cat to you. Wait. It's time, Naru. Your kühtaamia. When the lion comes, you tell that thing, "This is as far as you go. No more. This is it." It won't matter how sharp it is if you're too afraid to use it. You think you're ready? You've never faced a lion. Its mouth full of teeth like arrows, ready to tear your flesh and crush your bones. When your brother comes back, he and I will find the lion and kill it. Your brother carried you home. Wha... What about the lion? - Ta a be went after it. - Okay. I have to find him. No, you need to rest. Ihka. Drink this tea. Ihka. Puhi survived because of your medicine. There's something else out there. Ta a be needs my help. If your brother needed you, he wouldn't have brought you back here. You think the reason for kühtaamia is to prove you can hunt, but there's only one reason. To survive. Ta a be kima! Ta a be kima! - Naru. - War Chief. Naru. Where are you going? We did it. No. We didn't do it. What do you think left those tracks and skinned that snake? And before I fell, - I saw lightning in the trees. - Naru. - There's something else out there. - And if there is, I'll get it. We need to go back out. - Far, beyond the ridge line. - No. - Okay. Well, I'll hunt alone if I have to. - You can't. - Do I need your permission, War Chief? - It's not about permission. You can't. I had to carry you back. I can hunt. You're right. We didn't do it. I did. You tried it. You just… You couldn't bring it home. If they don't see, then show them. Kima. Next time, you're cooking. Kima. Nüma'ai kima. We have to go find whatever left those tracks. Ühkitsi. Tasiwoo Atsabi, yütsü tsaaku. Ürako taa ahpü yühmuku. Sarii? There you are. - What are you doing here? - Looking for you. Your brother sent us to bring you home. Where is he? Searching for you on the other side of the pass. Where are you going? - I saw it. - Saw what? I saw what left those tracks. - The bear? - There was a bear, but there was something else, and it was huge. I couldn't see it until it was covered in blood, but it looked like... Like a mupitsl. You saw a monster from a children's story? It fought and killed a bear with its hands, easily. How come it didn't kill you? Stop! You're going home. Enough! Aitü. You wanna leave? Then leave. We're going home. There's something out there. Quit it! Just sit. You need a leash for your weapon? Get some water. We'll rest a minute. Stay together. - What about Ta a be? - He'll meet us back at camp. I said stay together. I gotta go take a squat. You want me to do it here? Water. You should see your face. What do you think drove the possums our way? Hey. Cut me loose. Stay down. Shh. We have him. No. He has us. Regardez ici. Regardez ici. Une femme? Qu'est-ce qu'elle fait ici? Je vais la porter. Elle va nous ralentir. Non. Par la façon qu'elle courait, je crois qu'elle I'a vu. C'est ton nouveau blonde, hein? Dégagez-moi ce put a in de chien! Sarii? J'ai pas un bon sentiment avec ça. You killed the buffalo. Ah… T'es fâchée? Maintenant, tu vas payer. On va voir qu'est-ce qu'elle sait. - Parle, sale Raphael. - Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici, hein? - C'est un piège? - Qu'est-ce qui se passe? What did you see? I speak a lot of languages. You are Comanche, yes? - Je vais la tuer. - Non, non, non, non, non, non, non. On peut toujours I'utiliser. Ah. You should be helping us. I think this creature is a hunter, looking for the strongest beast. What do you know? It killed your whole party. Je vais la faire chanter. No. It didn't kill everyone. If you were smart, you'd help us. Sors le sauvage. Sortez-lui de la sacrée boîte! What? D'une façon ou d'une autre, tu vas nous aider. Fais-le saigner. Are you hurt? Oh, they tried. On n'aurait pas dû amener les chevaux. Fais-les taire ou la bête ne viendra pas. Son of a bitch. The thing the white men are trying to catch… …that's what you went out after? It's what you were tracking? Yes. And that's what you chose for kühtaamia? Elle est où cette pute de bête? J'ai faim et j'ai be so in de pisser. Qu'est-ce qui arrive? Oh, non, non, non. Qu'est-ce qui se passe? - Qu'est-ce qui arrive? - Qu'est-ce qui arrive? Rambert! Tire, Rambert! Merde. I need to get me a horse. Il est là! - It's coming. - Il est là! Orü posa kwitapÜ. Naru. Can you get your side loose? Naru. We're the bait. He's coming for us. No. No. It doesn't want bait. It doesn't hunt that way. Before the trappers captured me, it saw me. It came right up to me and then left. It didn't think I was a threat. You wanna know how I killed that lion? Your plan. The tree. You weakened it. You had it, Naru. You can see what I miss. You always have. I don't know that this thing can be killed. If it bleeds, we can kill it. Maintenant! Naru. Naru!
