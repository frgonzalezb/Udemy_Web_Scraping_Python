Come here, tighten this. Lasse, if you can, just put something in there ? ? to stop the bleeding, okay? ? Some gauze or bandages. ? Got it, got it. 6-0, this is 2-5. Ready for a partial 9-liner. Over. 1410. Over. ? 3814. ? 6-0, copy that. Out. ? 381410. ? Here. ? Anders Holm. GV1, 2. batallion. ? I need a status on him right now. 6-0, status from Papa. We need a complete 9-liner and a sitrep. Medevac ETA 15. He's not breathing. Very weak breathing. ? When is that medevac coming? ? Come on, Anders. Let's go. Not too high. That's right. ? Keep his mouth open. ? I can't feel anything here. ? Fuck, man! ? Lasse, calm down. ? Come on, Anders! ? Five! That's fucking ... ? Where is that fucking helicopter? ? Lasse, calm down. ? Let's go, let's go. ? He has no pulse in his wrist. Double amputation. Charlie is severely critical. ? Okay, he's bleeding out now. ? Come on! ... 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

Are you alright? I need you to stay focused. Okay? As you probably know, Anders was declared DOA at Bastion. ? How are the guys feeling? ? They're awful. Especially my second rifleman, Lasse. ? What about you? ? None of the guys feel good. We feel like walking targets. The guys are powerless. They can't do anything. The guys don't see the purpose of patrolling ... Hold on a sec. Let's see this from their perspective. The guys just lost a friend. They're frustrated. I'm just saying the assignments make no sense. I've just lost one of my 21-year-olds, ? ? who bled out right in front of me. THAT makes no sense! Of course it doesn't. Go take care of the guys. What are your thoughts on this? It's been a tough day. They need to let off some steam. We need to take care of this. I will patrol with them tomorrow and onwards. Gather the guys at 20.30. I'll brief them myself. Do any of you have any doubts about why you are here? It's to secure and help the civil population, ? ? so they can have a decent life and rebuild their land. I know you walk on patrol a lot, and that you use a lot of energy. But that's because we have momentum. We're getting the civilians on our side. That's why it's so important that we show our presence in the area. Where is he? ? Where is Julius? ? He's gone outside to play. We just have to talk to Birgitte now. Hi, Maria. Thanks for stopping by. Julius has been in a fight with one of the other boys today. ? Was it serious? ? Yes, he wouldn't calm down and he bit the other boy in the shoulder. Now, you yourself suggested that we should have a talk, ? ? you, me, and his head teacher. Yes, of course, let's do that soon. On Friday, I'll be off at 3. ? I could be here around 3.30. ? I'll just have a look in my calendar. Just a moment, please. Julius bit ... Julius bit a boy. Yes, he did, sweetie. You can't do that. When are we going home? As far as I can tell, it'll be a bit difficult find a time, ? ? but let's see if we can't. I have a lot to do on Friday but... Julius? Hey! It's time to go home. Come on. We need to go home now, Julius. Figne is waiting for us. Julius, come on now. Julius, sweetie? Julius? Come, dad's calling tonight. Come here. Oh, wow! ? What is eight plus eight? ? That's so easy. ? Sixteen. ? You're so ugly. ? You're so annoying. ? No, you are. What's twenty plus twenty? ? Forty. ? You look like an old guy called Morty. Why are you such a fucking pain? Alright, stop it. Turn off the TV, and go sit at the table. We eat in 5 minutes. Figne, I know he's annoying, but just leave him be. Alright, sit at the table. Elliot, please sit at the table. Sit at the table, so we can eat. ? Cut this. ? You want me to cut it? "Dear mom, please cut this for me." ? You are not a "dear mom". ? You are such a little rascal. Here, do the rest. Get some ketchup if you want, guys. Dad will be calling any minute now. ? What time is it? ? Only half past seven. ? That's a lot. ? Yeah, that is a lot, Elliot. You can go watch some TV. ? I want some milk. ? Then go get some milk. Can I have that? Easy, easy, easy ... You're such a good boy. I can drink a lot ... I can drink a lot of milk. Yeah, you can drink a whole liter. A whole carton. That wasn't good for me. No, that wasn't good for you. Don't worry about it. How are you? Who? How old was he? Are you alright? Okay, good. Well, we're ... We are fine. No, we're fine ... Well, they behave once in a while, you know. And then they're so ... ... fucking annoying sometimes. As always. Yeah, good for me, right. Really funny. You should look forward to coming home to those crazy kids. Mommy! Elliot just woke up. Could you call back in about two minutes? Okay. Okay. I love you too. We'll talk soon. I will. Bye, babe. Lasse? What's going on? I want to go home. Since that morning with Anders ... He wasn't even supposed to be there. He took my spot. And he was blown to pieces. I can't leave through these gates again. I'm not worth two shits. I can't send you home. What I can do... ... is give you assignments inside the camp for the next two weeks. That way you won't have to leave these gates for a while. And you can calm down. If you still feel down after a couple of weeks, we'll talk again. Do you have any family? Siblings or the like? I have a younger sister. She's 16. ? What's her name? ? Her name is Majida. She's starting high school soon. Fuck! Call home. I'll be back in 10 minutes and we'll have some coffee. Hello? It's me. Hey. Switch, guys. ? Salam alaikum. ? Hey, guys. Salam, salam. Wanna come along? No? Go away, go away! ? Go away. ? Keep away. Correct. EW reports, that "the pale guys" are in the area. (speaking Arabic) Stoffer, back in formation. ? In front of Michael? ? At the back. Now! ? Understood. ? Stoffer, go to the back now! ? That's the last time that happens. ? Understood. ? 2?5, 6?0. ? 2?5, over. Stop! Get out here! ? Get down! ? What's going on? Sit down! I need a translator! Sit down! Sit down! Calm down. We need a translator right now. Calm down, Rytter. Ease off. We need a translator here. Sit down, sit down. Tell him to sit down. Tell him to lift that up. (Arabic) His daughter is ill. He needs help. Shut up! ? Get Rytter in line right now. ? Rytter, come here. This way. (Arabic) He says, his daughter ... "My daughter is ill. Can you help me?" Where is his daughter? ? She's inside the house. ? Anybody else in there? (Arabic) Tell him to calm the fuck down. "She was burned here. Can you help us?" You have to calm down, otherwise we can't help you. ? There, straight ahead. There, left! ? Our guys are behind that door. ? He says to stop. He has to remove the women first. ? Look away. ? Look away? What do you think? Can you guys see anything? I can see two women. Come on, dammit. ? Easy, easy. ? "Come inside." Go away! There right, and women behind the door straight ahead. There is a donkey over there. ? You stay there. ? Is it in there? ? Yes, that's his house. ? In here? Get over here. Confirmed. A mother and two children and a girl with gauze on. Okay. Jones? Jones, get up here, now. "Thank you for helping us. We are poor people." ? Is it a burn? ? Yes. Left forearm. Salam alaikum. ? Tell him, he's welcome to enter. ? I need Stoffer in here right now. ? What's he saying? ? "It's this girl." Can you open this? Can I take a look at that? Can you ask her that? It's stuck in her wound. He has to tell the girl it's going to hurt. And he needs to hold her arm. Yes, it hurts. There it is. It's badly inflamed. Tell him, I can only rinse it with water. I don't have ... "What if it doesn't get better, then what?" I'm gonna put it in gauze, but he has to rinse it daily with soap. "Listen to her crying. She can't sleep at night." Tell them, if it gets worse, they can come to the camp. He knows where the camp is. "Thank you so much." There aren't any taliban here. They're regular civilians. The taliban comes sometimes. When we leave, they'll be here right away. ? When were they here last? ? "As soon as you get here, they run away." If we help you with the well and the water, ? ? could you help us with the mines? (Arabic) All they want is peace. (Arabic) He's ready for you down here. One second, okay? Okay, we're ready. Ready? And up! Hey, it's me. Hello? ? Hello? ? Can you hear me? Yeah, hi, baby. Hey. Are you all there? ? Yes, it's me and Julius. ? Where is Elliot and Figne? Elliot's sleeping. Figne doesn't want to talk today. Okay. ? Could I speak to Julius? ? Yeah, he's right here. Daddy? ? How are you? ? Good. I'm sorry, I didn't call last night, but ... That's okay. ? And you're good? ? Yes. ? Is that Maria? ? Julius. ? Can I say hi? ? Someone wants to talk to you. ? Hi, Julius. ? Hi. ? How are you? ? Good. I seem to remember, you owing me a joke. Is that right? Yeah. ? You wanna tell it? ? Yeah. ? Right now, or ...? ? Yeah, now. Alright, I'm listening. I'm listening. What? Julius, tell it. Here he is. Okay. Hi, Maria. Once there was a boy at the swimming pool. The lifeguard yelled at him: "Don't pee in the water." And the boy said: "All the others pee in the water, too." "Yeah, but not from the diving board" Not from the diving board? Was that what you said? That was really funny. You know what, you win. It was a lot funnier than mine. ? Did you have a joke, Najib? ? No, it was his turn. Well, I don't want to interrupt. Take care. ? You too. ? Goodbye, Julius. It's me again. I love you. We miss you, dad. Have a good day. Just run inside, okay? Julius? When you have binoculars, ? ? you point it at the wall ... Yes. Have a nice day. Julius, I don't have time for this. Don't do this. I don't want to fight with you. Have a nice day, okay? Run along. No, you didn't just do that. Why did you do that, Julius? Unlock the door. I asked you nicely. I can't leave Elliot by himself. Come on. Go inside. Oh no, you don't! Alright, get out. Elliot, you'll have to sit here by yourself. Come on. I have an RC here. Alright, you don't have to confirm any more. Just retreat. ? Down there. ? You can already see it from here. You can see the antenna there. It looks like a 105 grenade. Good work, guys. Get into position. Go back farther. Left of the children down by the road ? ? we have a large artillery grenade. Possible RC. I hesitate to send it to the TOC, until we find out, what we have to do. I'm not so nervous about the danger, because those girls stand so close to the road. As long as they're there, anything rarely happens. ? Butcher? ? What do you say, guys? Hotel 1?5, this is 6?5. Come to my position. I'm walking here, Butcher. ? What's your best position? ? By the rock up there. The rock up there? ? Butcher and I will go with you. ? Understood. 6?5 Oscar, this is 6?0. We expect to have green light in this area in 3?0 mike. Copy that.

Hotel 1?5, this is 6?5 Papa. You have permission to fire. This is Hotel 1?5, Copy. Out. ? Can you get him? ? Yeah. Fuck ... He's taking a boy with him. We don't have a free shot.

And do you know what this is? ? A motorcycle. Yes. And do you know what this is? ? A giraffe. ? Yes. Do you know what this is? ? A space rocket. ? What? A space rocket. A space rocket!

Have you had a good day at school? ? You don't need to ask about that. ? Why? ? Because I can say it myself. I know, you rascal. I just want to know that you are doing well. Aww. Did you hit your head? I just want to know you feel good. You need to tell me if something's wrong. ? When is dad coming home? ? Is that all you think about? Mhm. He'll be here in three months. It's not so long. Can I get a hug? What do I have to do to get a hug? Mom, Elliot has eaten something! ? What did he eat? ? Mom! How many did you eat? Elliot. Open your mouth. Is this Elliot? The doctor is ready for you in room six. Figne, take this and go sit in the waiting room, please. I'll be back as soon as possible. Keep an eye on Julius, okay? He ate some paracetamol? Yeah, he puked some out, but I don't know how many he has eaten. I'm just gonna put a bandaid on your chest. We have to probe him, so we can monitor him. And we have put in an NAC drop and give him some charcoal. ? I want my daddy ... ? He's not here right now, honey. Now you look here, Elliot. This is going in your mouth. It'll be uncomfortable for a moment, ? ? but we have to do it, so we can get all the pills up. ? And here it comes down into your stomach. ? I'll take the pacifier. It will be a bit uncomfortable, but your mother will be right here the whole time. Sit here, please. And now it's important, Elliot, that you lie completely still and open wide. ? Open the mouth. And suction. ? You are so good. And we have suction. Let's see if we can't wake them up. Figne? Hey, sweetie. Honey, don't cry. I wish that I was there. Maria ... Maria? I'll take the fives. ? Need some sleep? ? No, I'm fine. ? You have a lot on your plate right now. ? Yeah. When are you gonna stop going on patrol? Full House, 24 Look at this. I'll report it to 3-5. 3-5, this is main gate. We have civilians headed towards main gate. Copy that. ? I'll stand on the left. ? Copy. 6-0, this is 3-5. The four locals are now in London. They've been searched. I'm here with the translator. Out. Lars, close the gate. (Arabic) He says he has spoken to our commander. If the Taliban were after them that he would help. Copy that.. 6-0, this is 3-5. Local Afghan man approximately 60-65 years old ? seems to know "the commander". He must be referring to KC. Asalamu alaikum. Although you patrol at day, the Taliban comes at night. He says that the Taliban know we helped his daughter. Now they want him to be a warrior for them, otherwise they'll kill his family. Tell him that we'll come tomorrow and force the Taliban away from the area. (Arabic) "I can't go home. We have to stay here tonight." I'm sorry, but I have to ... I'm sorry. You have to go home now. Put your boy down. Put him down. Wait, wait. I myself have three children. (translator translates) I understand your situation. But in order for us to help you, you will have to go home. "Your children live in safety though." He says that if they go back, they will be killed. "Take care of the children, and I'll leave." His children will be killed. We have to go to the village in the morning anyway... Stop that right now. "What should I do?" We will be there tomorrow. We'll secure the area, and force the Taliban out. We'll protect you and your family. You have my word. Rytter, ready the gate. They can't stay here. There have been a low number of incidents in AO. The assessment is, that they are waiting until they understand our intention in the area. There has been massive digging activity out there ? ? and they undoubtedly monitor our every move. It's my job to be the merchant of death as an intelligence officer. It won't be long before we see a reaction. They report that it is very quiet down there today. It could be a combat indicator, that the locals have left the area. The Taliban may be ready and waiting for us. If they are, we'll just have to remove them. ? Any risk reports? ? None. We're going down to see that family. I'll take Lars, Jones, ? ? Michael, Butcher, Stoffer and Lasse with me. We'll enter Compound 3 and look in on the family. You'll continue to the other side, and back us up from there. Look at this. We'll all go down to the well. From the well, you'll go directly south gain insight on Compounds 6, 7 and 8. Copy. 6-0, 6-5 Oscar, Over. 2-5 reporting, very low levels of activity. Over. We are monitoring you ? ? and don't have indications of activity, either. Copy. Out. Say that we are going in with weapons, unless they say something. (interpreter in Arabic) ? Room on the right. ? Blue door straight ahead. Room clear. Focus on the blue door. Fuck ... This is 6-0. We're here. The aforementioned family, we helped, we've localized them. They've all been killed. The boy was shot in the head. The girl was shot two three times in the chest and neck. The mother was hit in the face. Take Lasse to 2-5. There is no reason for him to be here. We'll come to you, when we're done. Lasse. Lasse. Come here. Look at me. Are you alright? 6-0. Over. We'll stay for an additional 05 and then leave the village ? ? and go back toward London. Confirm. Over. This is 6-0. Copy that. Out. (explosion) Get away, Jones! 6-0, 6-5 Oscar. Out. ? Can you see anything? ? No. ? What about 2-5? ? 2-5 has our backs. Can you gain insight? I see nothing. All I see is it's coming from the left side. ? 2-5 has no insight! ? 2-5 has no insight. ? I think the sound came from Compound 6 ? There's nothing to see there. Boss! Lasse is hit! ? What's the position? ? Give position. ? I'm by the well! ? He's out by the well. 2-5 has no insight! ? Michael! ? He was hit in the neck! Help me! I need help right now! ? Where was he hit? ? In the neck. Lasse, Lasse! Look at me! He's good. Let's take him over here. Come on. ? Michael, secure it. ? Got it. Go! ? Butcher! ? Butcher's coming! ? Jones! Where do you want him? ? Up here! Where was he hit? Keep the pressure. 2-5, this is 6-5. Send me a sitrep. Are you in contact? Over. ? This is 2-5. This is 2-5. ? Stoffer! They are firing from several directions. I have no insight. I've got you. Lasse, we are gonna cut up your shirt, so Jones can check on you. Jones has to check on you. Lasse? I've got you. ? Where is that fucking medevac?! ? Michael, where can it set down? On the north side of the village. 2-5, we have to sweep a landing site. Get it going. 2-5, I am engaged. I can't do it. ? I've got you, Lasse. ? We need that fucking medevac! Get down! ? Lars! Michael! Is everything alright? ? Yes. I don't see anything. 2-5, this is 6-5. We have to sweep a landing site. Reply, dammit! This is 2-5. I can't do it. Out. ? Hold it tight. ? Lasse, look at me. Are you there? Lasse, look at me. You'll make it. We are getting you home. ? Are you there, Lasse? ? Lasse! Lars and Michael, behind you! ? Insight? ? That direction plus 200. 2-5, I need a clear enemy report. Come on! I don't have a clear enemy report. They are in a western direction. Western direction? Where the hell are they? Lars, I'm behind you. Insight? ? Negative. ? Same as Lars. RPG! ? I'm okay. ? Michael? Butcher, this is critical! ? We need air support. ? 6-0, we need air support. His heart rate is dropping! He's getting worse. Verify coordinate Compound 6. On the six? I've got it. ? Lasse! ? What's happening, Jones? ? Lasse, look up. ? Lasse, look at us! What's going on? We're not getting air support, unless we have PID. ? We need to get Lasse out of here. ? 7-5 wants to know who's in there. ? I don't give a shit who's in there! ? I know, but it's 7-5 asking! Then tell them, I know who's in there! We have to get out of here! We have PID on Compound 6. Repeat: PID on Compound 6. Come on, god dammit! ? 0-2 mike! ? 0-2 mike on air support! Jones! ? Come on. Lasse, look at me. ? One, two, three! ? Now look at me. There we go! ? He's back! Pancake around 15 Sierra! Three, two, one ... (explosion) ? Lasse, come on. ? I'll get the door. ? Come on, Lasse! ? Nice and easy. ? Lay him down. ? Hold his head. ? Is there a helicopter for Lasse now? ? I have him right here. Easy. Easy, Stoffer. Step away, please. Breathe. Jones, we need you in position. ? Come on, Lasse! ? Protect him from the wind. Sit down. Nice and easy. Loosen the helmet a bit. You'll get some air. That's okay. It's alright. Okay? Good work. Okay? He'll be fine. It's alright to be sad. We're all sad. It's completely alright. Stoffer, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. ? Hey, hey! Get out of ... ? Out of the vehicle. Let's go! ? There must be something ... ? I'll get him from the other side. ? Some guy has locked himself inside. ? I can see him through the window. Out! Out! Out! ? Out of the car. Now. ? Get out. ? No, there. ? Get him to lie down. ? Get him down. ? I have him under control. Stay still, buddy. Okay? Stay still! Nice and easy, buddy, alright? ? 50% on the vehicle. ? Butcher, 50% on pat down! Stay still. Michael, we have a mobile phone. Good work, boys. Now Michael will just get the last E in. Just as soon as we are done here get them into the vehicle, and point them north. (Arabic) Now, do what I tell you. I don't want any bullshit from you. Raven will follow them north. The mobile phone was clean. Expect to release them in 02. Please stand up. Get up, guys. You know what that means. Come on! Copy that. We'll release them in 01 So if you can follow them ... As you know, Lasse was hit in the neck ? ? and flown to Bastion. Then he was flown to England ? ? where they patched him up. 00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:19,260 I miss you 00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,960 NOT! 00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:28,260 Can't eat 00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:34,660 But the food is also 00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,660 really shitty! Awesome. 00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49.320 Thanks, boss 00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:52.620 I heard that you 00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.120 saved my life 00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:07.120 Look out for each other ? There's more. ? A sponge cake? ? Now there's more cake for you. ? It's a new one. Another one. That makes it a 1000. Yay! Oh, thank you. Come here. I'm keeping this. I want this for myself. ? Is he coming home for Christmas? ? Yes. ? Whoops. ? It's amazing how you can keep it up. That's just ... That's just the way, it is. ? But Julius is reacting a bit these days. ? How so? Trouble at school and such. He just needs to adjust. He's at an age where he starts to understand more ... ... can express it more. Did you hear that my guys made a deal with the locals? They bought a goat and named it Richard. Where is it? In a small enclosure next to my bunk. I've seen more meat on a bouillon cube. ? Do you have two minutes? ? Now? ? Ten minutes. ? Alright. ? What's going on? ? The commander is in your office. Got two guys from the Advocate Corps with him. What's it about? I don't know. Okay. Thanks. ? Hey, Claus. ? Commander. What's this about? We have to interview you about some claims regarding civilian casualties. Although you are not charged, you have the right to remain silent. But we can't promise you won't be charged at a later point in time. What would I be charged for? So you want to make a statement, do I have that right? Yes. What do you want to ask about? Can you confirm that you and your men were present in Adam Khan Kalay ? ? on September 21 at 9:30? I can confirm that. We have been told that you gave orders to attack Compound 6. ? Is that correct? ? Yes. We were in close contact with the enemy. And the enemy, that you refer to, was located in Compound 6? Yes. That's why, we called for air support on it. You are charged with bombing a civilian target ? ? and thus caused the deaths of 11 civilians. What does that mean? It means you are going home, Claus. There he is. I want to hug him first. ? Are you gonna get that, Figne? ? No, I will. I'm a manly man. ? I'll get it. ? Are you sure? Let's go. ? I can't do it! ? I thought you were a man. ? What's in it? ? I'll get it. We'll put the grey one here and a white one on each side. Thanks. There! Then we'll ... Which one should we put there? Those. We should get those. Is he asleep? ? I'm not asleep. ? No, Elliot. We'll have an orange one there and there. I'm almost done. Can I see yours? ? We are almost done. ? You are such a little rascal. You are so silly. You need to tell me why you've come home. I'm cold. I've received the case files: testimony from your men, ? ? a video from a helmet cam, in which you give the order for the attack on Compound 6. And some photographs. I will contest their authenticity. I'll to have them thrown out, ? ? because we have no idea who has taken them ? ? although they claim, they were taken at the scene of the crime. Their claim is that you ordered a bombing of a civilian target ? ? without PID. ? What is PID? ? It means if I saw the enemy there. You are accused of violating the Military Criminal Code, ? 36.2. And what does that mean exactly? It means that you have been accused of killing civilians. What is the penalty for that? It will probably be a jury trial, in which the maximum penalty is four years. But let's not anticipate events. What do we do now? The most important question is, ? ? if Compound 6 was a military or a civilian target. That's the whole case. Did you have PID, Claus? I had a strong assumption that the Taliban where... ? I'll have to stop you right there. Did you have PID? ? I had a strong ... I gotta stop you again. You need to understand that, right now, ? ? it's assumed to be a civilian target. People live there. People's homes were bombed. As far as I can tell from the witness reports, ? ? nothing indicates, that you had PID. Does that matter? He says, his men are wounded and bleeding. ? It's his duty to save them. ? I understand that very well. But you have to understand, that to everyone else, Claus is a soldier ? ? who killed 11 people. Alright. Let me be completely honest with you. In this store I sell acquittals. Morality and ethics is not my department. The prosecution will claim, that the case is about 11 dead civilians. If you have even the slightest doubt, that you had PID, ? ? they will try to get you convicted. If you can say to me now without a doubt that you had PID, ? ? there is a very good chance I can get you acquitted. It's that simple. I can't just lie. I didn't know, who was in that house, Maria. It was my responsibility, and I have to suffer the consequences. You must suffer the consequences? What about the children? What about me? We need you at home. You have been gone for a very long time. ? Julius is struggling with it. ? What the hell was I supposed to do? Huh? It's not about what you were supposed to do, but what you do right now. Would it help you to go to prison for four years? Would you get better? Would the children get better? We need you at home! The children need you! I dropped that bomb. It was my decision. ? I can't just blame my men. ? Alright, but then do what he says. Say you had fucking PID. Say, you can't remember who confirmed it. Maybe you killed eight children, but you have three living ones at home! I'm sorry. Claus, we'll go over here. Maria, you have to sit over there. ? Hey, boss. Good to see you. ? Hi. Hello. ? Can I take your coat? ? How sweet. Thanks. That's your seat, Claus. You can just put your jacket here. Thanks. Take a seat, please. Remember what we talked about. When it gets hard, ? ? look at me and breathe, okay? It'll be alright. Claus, stand up. ? Good morning. Please be seated. ? Thank you. Alright, today we're processing the case ? ? the Military Prosecution Service versus Claus Michael Pedersen. Claus Michael Pedersen, is that you? ? Yes. ? Good. ? Tell me when you were born. ? 04-02-80. Yes, that is correct. And we can continue the case with a statement. Can I interrupt for a moment. The prosecution's evidence involves these photographs, ? ? specifically, exhibit 35. I would like to question the authenticity of these photographs, ? ? and I ask the court to make them inadmissible. Alright. And what do you say? I don't agree. I will explain how we acquired the photographs, ? ? and the authenticity of the photographs was verified by the military police. Okay. Do you have any other remarks on your part? ? No. This case is about ? ? whether the defendant had the necessary information to give orders to bomb, ? ? if Compound 6 a military target or not. A recording from the helmet camera of constable Lars Holm plays an important part ? ? to the military prosecution. That is the exhibit 27. It is the opinion of the prosecution ? ? that the video clip shows the basis of the decision of the defendant ... ... Or lack thereof. I will now play the video. 6-5 Oscar, out. We're not getting air support, unless we have PID. The TOC must be sure. ? 7-5 wants to know who's in there. ? I don't give a shit who's in there! I know, but it's 7-5 asking! Then tell them, I know who's in there! We have to get out of here! We have PID on Compound 6. Repeat: PID on Compound 6. Alright, thank you. In closing, there is the photographic material ? ? delivered to the military police in the English brigade. They then transferred the material to the Danish military police. It's six photos. I have to warn you that, these are explicit images. Begin. Yes. Photo number one. And photo number two. Photo number three. And number four. Number five. And ... photo number six. Thank you. Does the defence have any comments? No. Alright, then we'll move on to the witnesses. Jones is screaming. Lasse's condition is critical, ? ? so we call in a medevac to get him out. Immediately thereafter we were hit by yet another grenade. I attempt to gain insight but I can't, ? ? so I seek cover by this wall in the southwest corner ? ? of Compound 3 with Butcher. Butcher is Kenneth Jensen, the communications officer? Yes, Kenneth Jensen. Then I get a report that the Taliban are in Compound 6. Okay. Claus, at what time exactly ... ... are you informed, that the enemy is in Compound 6? I don't remember exactly. But you remember, that you have identified Compound 6 as a military target? Yes. Alright. Before we continue, you can just sit back down. I think we have a good overview of the circumstances. Thank you. (whispering) Let's just continue down this road. Alright. I would like to quote from exhibit 27a: "I don't give a shit who's in there. We need to get Lasse out. " And shortly thereafter: "Tell them I know who's in there. We have to get out of here." This is contrary to what you said. ? No, it's not. ? Would you elaborate on that? You need to understand. When I get a report that they won't grant air support, ? ? but it's the only thing that can save me and my men, ? ? I see it as my duty to get it granted. Who told you, where the enemy was located? I don't remember. Because we were under heavy fire! I don't remember! 2-5 is on the radio and two men in contact with the enemy. Jones and Stoffer are fighting to save Lasse's life. Oscar is in constant contact with the TOC at home. I do not remember who said what. But you know who is located in Compound 6? I react to a report that the enemy is in there. Did you also know, that there were women and children? ? No, I did not. ? Okay ... Thank you, that's all I have. Does the defence have any questions for the defendant? Yes. I have a few questions, thank you. Claus, when you say, ? ? as we've heard in the clip taken from a helmet cam: When you say, "Tell them I know, who's in there, "? ? what does that mean? Does it mean "Lie and just say, that I know, who's in there? " Or: ?Tell them I know. Confirm that I know who's in there?" ? What does it mean, Claus? ? It means I had PID. I didn't want to waste time discussing it. ? ? Not with my men on the ground, nor the people in TOC. That's all I've got. The defendant can sit back down next to their lawyer. ? Okay, so let's write that there. ? Yeah. He buys two packets of plastic figurines. The packet with the five figurines costs a tenner, so that makes it ... ? What? ? Twenty. Two times ten is twenty. 48. 48 + 20 + 18. ... + 20 + 18. What is 24 + 18? 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ... There. 42. Exactly. 42. ? Are you tired? ? Nah. You know what Mom and I are doing these days, right? ? Seeing if you have to go to prison. ? Mhm. Okay, lie down. Dad? Is it true, that you killed some children? Did you at any time observe hostile activity from Compound 6? No. I'll make the assumption that you, in the combat situation ? ? didn't direct Pedersen's attention toward that compound. That is correct. Did you at any time observe any enemy activity in Compound 6? No. Since you didn't observe anything, I'll assume ? ? you didn't direct Pedersen's attention toward that compound? ? That is correct. ? Thank you. ? I have no further questions. ? And the defence? Can you with 100 % certainty deny that the enemy was located in Compound 6? ? No, certainly not. ? Thank you. I would like to call the next witness. Najib Bisma. Welcome. Just take a seat right there, Najib. Take a seat, please. Does a company commander normally patrol ? ? as much as Claus Michael Pedersen did? That is, put himself in the line of fire like that? Most bosses go on a few patrols, but ... Claus is the type that takes charge and shows the way, ? ? and he did that a lot the last month or so down there. ? Did you think that was appropriate? ? There were pros and cons. You did talk about it with the defendant, is that correct? I mentioned it to Claus, but that was for his own sake. How so? Were you concerned about his judgment in the time leading up to this incident? No, not worried ... According to your signed testimony ? ? you did have doubts about his judgment. I quote: "He had trouble prioritizing important tasks." That is verbatim from your testimony. Claus is my friend. We started at officer school together ? ? and I know his family, so I was worried about Claus. At a personal level, not as my boss. But he was your boss. He was the head of a whole company. Your boss exhibits, according to you, signs of impaired judgment. He has difficulty prioritizing tasks ? ? and ends up in serious combat with several wounded. Then he orders the bombing of a compound in the village. Did you consider, as next-in-command, ? ? that something went terribly wrong out there? That is a difficult question because ... You can't imagine, what it means to be out there. Claus is the most capable soldier I know. And ultimately it is our responsibility to get our men back home in one piece. That is what we are there for. But he shouldn't have been out there with them. We should have been in the camp with the overview. That's all for me. Thanks. Hey. I gotta do something, Maria. I gotta to do something. Hey. Come on. There there. Hey. We need you. Hey! Yes, Kenneth Jensen, or Butcher ... That is what we have mostly heard you referred to as. I was called Butcher, colloquially. It's a nickname. ? Where does it come from? ? That's a long story. My father was a butcher. And I have two brothers. ? So we just got the nicknames Butcher. ? Butcher and Butcher. There was Little Butcher, Medium Butcher, and Big Butcher. Okay good. In this court, we have heard the sound from a video clip, ? ? in which you pass on orders from the defendant ? ? to bomb Compound 6. At the time, did you know the reason for that order? Yes, I did. It was me who told Claus, ? ? that I could see muzzle flashes from Compound 6. Will the audience please refrain from commenting? Could you repeat that? I told Claus that I saw muzzle flashes coming from Compound 6. This is completely new to me. How is it possible for you ? ? to provide that information to the defendant from your location behind the wall? We have heard several accounts of how chaotic it was. We have heard that you were lying in cover with him behind the wall ? ? and that you were under heavy fire. We were, but the boss gets up to gain insight ? ? on the compounds from which the shots are coming. I get up behind him. And then I see some muzzle flashes coming from Compound 6 ? ? and the surrounding area, and I inform him of this. When we're back in cover behind the wall, ? ? he asks me to verify coordinates on Compound 6. And then I can call TOC and ask for the air support we got. On the audio sequence from Lars Holm's helmet camera ? ? nothing indicates that you or the defendant did what you are now saying. I wasn't really near Lars. I was behind the boss. So I can't comment on what's on that audio clip. I'm just telling you ? ? that it doesn't match your statement, ? ? but that it is very consistent with your previous testimony. May I just point out to the court, ? ? that testimony is not signed. ? Is that true? ? That is correct. It is exhibit 23. There is nothing odious about it not being signed. The witness was on his way to patrol, when he testified. It was written on a laptop in the camp ? ? and it was read through on the screen. I was just pointing it out. ? It has been noted. ? But back to you, Kenneth. It was made in Afghanistan, a few days after the incident occurred. In it you don't mention any muzzle flashes ? ? or any enemies around Compound 6, none of this new information. I wasn't asked about those specifics, either. If I had been, I would have answered. ? You have to be asked specifically about that? ? Not necessarily. But I wasn't asked. We had just been in enemy contact two-three days before. A man was critically wounded, and we were on our way out in that same area again. Then I was questioned. And unfortunately, no. I didn't mention anything about it. Obviously, I'm sorry about that. But, well ... That's the way it is. Does the prosecutor have anything else? Your company commander is in difficulties and has been indicted for half a year. The information you're bringing forward now, ? ? would have been of significant importance to both the man and his case. Do you want me to believe, ? ? that at no point did it occur to you ? ? to share any of this information? ? It's been six months. ? Yes, it has. Sorry. ? Was that it? ? Yes, that was it. Thank you. Does the defence have any questions for the witness? No, I can't seem to think of anything right now. Then you are done. You may leave or sit with audience, if you so please. The law is clear: The prohibition against arbitrary attacks is of central importance ? ? in the protection of the civilian population. At no point has the defendant been able to justify ? ? why he decided to attack. He says someone in the unit identified Compound 6 as a hostile target, ? ? but he hasn't indicated who or specified further circumstances. The court has heard me question every single soldier in the vicinity of the defendant, ? ? who would have been able to identify Compound 6. And one soldier, Kenneth 'Butcher' Jensen, waited until court to inform us ? ? that he observed the muzzle flashes and conveyed it to the defendant. I have no trust in the witness, ? ? because in the sound recording ? ? we can clearly hear the exchange of words between the defendant and Butcher ? ? up until the order: "I don't give a shit who's in there." And when next-in-command in TOC insists on PID: "Tell them, I know who's in there." I see a man who disregards the need of a civilian population ? ? to save his own guy, Lasse. Is that understandable from a human perspective? Yes. We can probably all understand the difficult dilemma. But although we have sympathy for the defendant, ? ? who appears to be a competent soldier and leader ? ? and although we must provide Danish soldiers room for manoeuvreability ? ? in extreme circumstances, no one is above the law. Otherwise, a judicial system is rendered superfluous. If we in a case like this ? ? let such a serious violation of humanitarian rights slide, ? ? we will end somewhere, where we do not want to be. Claus Michael Pedersen must be sentenced because there is no doubt ? ? that he intentionally disregarded the elementary rules of engagement. Basically, the penalty in ? 36.2 ? ? is prison for life. Now, however, this is a jury trial, ? ? because the defendant did not have the intention to kill civilians. But their deaths are a direct consequence of his decision. The maximum penalty is four years. It is my contention, that we are close to that maximum. With these remarks, I rest my case. I would like to remind the court, that it is the prosecutor ? ? who has the burden of proof ? ? and must prove beyond any reasonable doubt ? ? that my client is guilty. The point of contention was quite simply, if my client had PID. My client says loud and clear, that he did. The prosecutor claims that he did not. But then we hear communications officer Kenneth Jensen, Butcher, tell us ? ? it was he, who saw the muzzle fire coming from Compound 6. That it was he who identified Compound 6 as a military target ? ? and not as a civilian target, as the prosecutor claims. My client, Claus Michael Pedersen, had PID. If Danish soldiers, who put their lives one the line, are prosecuted ? ? for violations of the military criminal code, on conjecture, ? ? THEN we'll be somewhere, we do not want to be. Therefore, I must call for acquittal on all charges. And with that, I rest my case. Thank you. Now it's your turn, Claus Michael Pedersen, you have the last word. Do you have anything to add, that has not already been said? No. Then we will retire and deliberate on the case. The verdict will be handed down on Thursday the 14th Let me go in front. This one's good! ? Here! Throw it. ? This one's good. Two! ? Dad? ? Yes. ? Look at this rock. ? Did you found an nice rock? ? No. ...'s got a hole in it. ? What? ? Hold it like this. ? Show him a rock skip. ? Hello! ? Can you see me? ? How many fingers am I holding up? ? Two. ? Okay, are you ready? ? No!! ? What? ? What a weak shot. Yeah, it was a silly shot. We will now pronounce the verdict. Claus Michael Pedersen is acquitted. The Treasury will pay the costs of the trial. Can I ... Can I ... Can I please have order in the court? A reaction is understandable, but please, refrain from it. Please sit down, and I will provide the reasoning for the verdict. The verdict is unanimous, ? ? and that means that we all three agree with the result. ? This is Afghanistan, right? ? Mhm. ? And that is Denmark, right? ? Mhm. And this is Madagascar, that is South Africa ? ? and this is Brazil, and this is Italy. Or I mean ... What was it? ? USA. ? USA. ? Come. ? USA. USA. ? Now go to bed. USA. ? Dad? ? Do you have to go away again? ? No. I don't. ? So you'll stay at home now? ? Yes. Could you tuck me in tomorrow then? Could you? I sure can. ? I love you. ? I love you too. Good night.
