He burned him alive. Be careful! He ran away... with Anne. He pretended to be sick. He's the one who killed the cop! Did he tell you I was a psychopath? Who is he, the devil? I can't call the police. Would they still hurt you? Lock you door. You've been running for years. - Nicolas! - Where's Nicolas? He's the psycho's son? Olivier's waiting for me. Mommy ! Be careful! We have to find him before he gets to the Inn. What are they doing here? Hello, Ms. Weiss, I'll open up... - How long have you been here? - Since noon. - We're still... - Did you see my son? - On his bike, 10 minutes ago. - 10 minutes ago? - Shit ! - Is he running away? Everything's fine. Mommy? Please pick up, Nicolas! He's not allowed to pick up the phone. That's not what we agreed on, I refuse... What? Hold on, someone's coming, 'bye! Hi, you must be Nicolas. I'm Anne, did your mom... Do you know where she is? No idea. Your mom's very secretive. Who were you talking... I wasn't talking to anyone. It's none of my business. Hey, where are you going? To find my mother. Outside? It's too dangerous. Wait for her here. Do you like eagles? I took some great shots today, wanna see? I don't bite, you know. Next time. You scared me! What's going on? Don't worry, it's nothing. Come on, let's get your stuff ready, we're sleeping at Jérôme's tonight. Go inside. Take the wheel... He drank a little at the restaurant... Sorry, I can't stay here tonight. That's O.K., I understand. Are you sure you'll be O.K.? I haven't drunk like that since my wedding. I wanted to rejuvenate... I'll handle it, I know the house. Good night! I'm gonna make sure he's not here. What if your psycho gets them? He's wouldn't risk ruining his revenge like that. He's sleeping. What did you tell him? That the bad guys had found us, but we'd be O.K. He pretends to believe me, he's sweet. You two will be fine, Laura. I called some friends in Spain, they can help. He'll find us no matter where, I know what he's capable of, I can't live while he's free. You want to go to the police? You'll go to prison... I may be able to avoid it. I'm gonna go see Gilles tomorrow, maybe he can keep my name out of this. Why would your cop friend do that? Is he still I in love with you? He said he wanted to help. - And you? - What about me? How do you feel about him? Don't tell me you're jealous? I'm not, I offer to help but you prefer his help, totally normal. This isn't about my feelings, he's a cop! He's qualified to deal with this. You really think that little rifle'll scare him? Wake up, will you? I'm sorry. I just don't want you to get killed. I need you, kiss me... Go to bed, you're exhausted. My little rifle and I will keep guard. Maybe this is for the best. We can't keep hiding. Especially you. Even if I go to prison, I'll be thinking of you. Prison walls can't keep us apart, neither can a crazy guy, no one can. I'll never abandon you, sweetie, never. Gilles and the photographer! - Hi, Laura, coffee? - No, thanks. I heard about yesterday's accident. - Are you O.K.? - I pulled a muscle. Good thing I go slowly, if it had been you... Mr. Mathieu is making a cane for me. - Here you go. - Thanks! Is Mr. Saron still sleeping? No, he got up at dawn to try to hunt one last time. Wants to go back victorious. Did he say where he was going? The Big Cross plateau. I'm gonna go find him. If I miss him, ask him to call me. He thought he wasn't your type... I just need a lawyer, it's urgent. Have a good day. - Where's Nicolas? - Still sleeping. Did you see your Gilles? He left his room with the photographer. What does that mean? That they're both working for Olivier. I went by the guide's office. Gilles isn't in the Valley Cup. He came here to spy on me, with that girl staying at the Inn! They're working for Olivier? He couldn't have escaped prison alone, that's why Gilles came. A cop and a murderer? A murderer who robbed 20 banks and never said where the money was. He came out of prison a rich man, cops don't make a lot. Hide at the police station. Gilles will come get me, and they'll let him. He's a big Parisian cop. No, I need someone higher up. That's why you wanna talk to the lawyer? He has contacts, and he owes me one. It's not worth it, Laura. You're not a criminal, it was 10 years ago. Maybe he's following orders. I'm going, Do what Jérôme says. - Where are you going? - To get help. I'll be right back. The Great Cross path leaves from the Inn, what if... I don't plan on taking the path. You think she'll be back soon? I hope so. Is the photo lady with them? Why? I'd seen her before, when mom got the medal. And in front of the school. - Your school? - The paragliding school. Are you sure about this? So she knows where you are, let's go ! Did you open a window? Stay there. Mr. Saron? Mr. Saron, can you hear me? What's wrong? Olivier? Is that you? Can you hear me? Stop right there! Shit! She got away, she took my quad. Stop! There's nothing on her. Nothing in her bag... Okay, I'll take it with me. Wake up, your boyfriend's waiting. Olivier? Mathieu, the bio teacher, who collects herbs, and goes back with pounds of powder in bags, like the one I found in his room. What is it? - What do you think it is? - Drugs? He's a drug trafficker? Oh, you had no idea, it crosses the border by itself, and Mathieu stays at your Inn every time he stocks up. The judge won't buy that, get up! Who's Olivier, your supplier? I don't understand, who are you? Lieutenant Anne Sorbier, come here! Your luck ran out, we're talking years behind bars. Mathieu's been waiting for you. I have nothing to do with this. All the dealers stay at your Inn. What dealers? Rafael, the computer scientist from Bayonne, or Cédric, you don't know them? They're good customers but... You didn't know they dealt? You thought they came here for your cooking? I said walk! It's because of the boarder, but I'm not involved in this! Get behind the quad! Get up it can explode! Mathieu! - Gilles followed Mathieu? - Yes! Jérôme, it's me. Gilles's after me, he killed Anne, call me back. You should have told us about this operation. I was infiltrating the network, my partner's qualified... Captain, captain! Is she your partner? Block the roads, the paths, everything. Find me Laura Weiss, let's go! I'm sorry. It's my fault. She knew Laura was in charge, only Laura can get across the boarder so fast. Why didn't you stop her earlier? I told them to wait for the swap, I didn't think Laura could... What did she do that with? Tell the guys she's armed. Why kill her accomplice? He knew too much. Little Laura really fooled us, such a nice girl, a drug dealer. She killed your partner, shot one of my guys, we're gonna lock her up, she's gonna have to pay. Mommy! Where's Jérôme? He's dead, he killed him, and I'm... Olivier, you're listening, it's me you want, so let him go! He's your son, do you hear me? O.K., I'm coming, I'll be right there. But if you touch one hair on his head, you're dead. Do you understand? I'll kill you myself if I have to. You have 1 hour and 45 to get to the hideout, Nicolas and I are waiting. If your late, or if you call the cops, he dies. Olivier, your psychopathic friend. Bad idea, you shouldn't have come back. Why did you do that? I trusted you! Me too, until you shot Anne. You killed her! What? Turn around! How much did they pay you to give him my son? What're you saying? Olivier Frainaud, ring a bell? Where does he come into this? He took Nicolas, and you helped him, it's your fault. I'm a cop. I don't know Frainaud. - I came back to help you. - Help me? I heard you were dealing drugs, I asked to be part of the operation. I couldn't believe it, or forget you. You shot me with a crossbow. I was watching you rope down... to see your accomplice, I thought. I saw the lawyer passed out, the crossbow was on the ground. That's all. The bullets are all here. How did you shoot her? I didn't shoot anyone, I have nothing to do with this drug story, I swear. O.K., I believe you. Don't move! Don't move! I have no choice, I'm sorry. You really wanna help me? Tell the cops you saw me going to the valley, that way they'll stop searching, O.K.? Where will you go? I have 1 hour and a half to save Nicolas. I have to go by the Inn first. I'm coming with you, why did Frainaud take him? He'll kill him if you come. And he'll see you form there. - He'll see you. - He's waiting for me. You think I'm gonna let you go? Even if I canceled the roadblocks, they'd find you in no time. I just want them to stop watching the Inn, I'll take care of the rest. Laura, I'm a cop, I can't let you go. You'll have to shoot for real. Oh, it's you! We saw a quad nearby, we thought... I missed her, he drove away. - You saw her leave? - Yes. She went to the valley, we'll get her. Take me to the HQ. - Roadblocks gone? - Yep. Send the cars out after her, keep me updated. Are you sure you saw her running to the valley? Positive, why? Because two hikers saw a young woman running to the Inn, in the opposite direction. I sent a patrol car to check. Call them back now. Are you joking? It's an order! Do you understand? Alright. When I get such a surprising order, I like to have it in writing. To establish the responsibility, just in case. In that case, do you also need a paper to bring me an official map? Is that all? I'd like to ask you a personal favor. A lot of personal elements in this case, maybe too many? But ask me, we'll see. Let's go, she was seen in the valley! Thanks, Gilles. The cops came looking for you. I'm sure they did. Do you know where the others are? Denis, hospital, Anne and Mathieu, dead. Any other questions? - You killed them all? - No. - Why do you have a gun? - Stop! Let me leave! Listen, my son was kidnapped. You're lying. I don't care if you believe me. I have an hour left to save him, understand? I don't want to hurt you but if you call the police, my son will die. I know how you feel, I'm a mother too. What happened to him? No time for explanations. If the cops come, don't tell them you saw me. I don't know if I can help. You can, you can pray. I no longer believe in God. How much can a champion hike or an hour and an hour and a half? 12 to 16 miles. Thank you. - Good news. - Nothing new. We have roadblocks every 500 meters, we're covering all the possible road paths. Either she's hiding, or your guesses were off. Impossible. You don't like me very much. I'll tell you when this is over. Here's the info you asked for, your personal favor. - Are you sure about this? - Yes. You still sure of your guesses? I need a car. I guessed as much, sorry about the color, police blue! It was the only choice. You have 1 hour and 45 to find the hideout, Nicolas is waiting. Where's Laura? Laura? I haven't seen her. - The truth! - I promise I... Two years for false testimony. She was here less than an hour ago, where did she go? She told you her son was taken? It's probably true but she's got the wrong guy. This way, they'll both die. I don't know anything. She took mountain gear, ropes. - And her top? - On top? No, the anorak. A blue anorak. Was there a badge? A dog's head, a Dachshund? No, a Saint-Bernard, the mountain rescuer's symbol. That's good news! Thank you! I thought... Your psycho slit my throat? Sorry to have scared you. - Where's Nicolas? - Next door, he's fine. Stay there! Don't move! The blood at your house, Nicolas's call. The countdown, was that you? A little mise en scène. I had to keep you away from the cops. They're looking for a big dealer... who killed Mathieu and the cop. They think it happens at the Inn, that your organize it. You're involved in this? I fly. Customs doesn't stop paragliders. One flight a week, to supply my clients at the Inn. That way it was easier to see them. I would have told you if the cops had asked... So you used me? At first, I got close to you because of the Inn. But then I didn't fake anything, that's why it's hard. You killed Anne and Mathieu? I had no choice! Mathieu, when I killed the cop... You killed him? I panicked, he caught us, it was late at night! What are you gonna do to us? You plan on killing us too? You should have said yes to Spain! Let me go then, the boarder's 2 miles away. I won't tell, I swear! Maybe you won't, but Nicolas knows too much. I don't want to rot in prison! Kill us then, I'm sure he'll love that! - Who? - Olivier. Nicolas is his son, remember? What do you think he'll do to his son's killer? You don't fool me. He follows me everywhere, day and night, on the hill this morning, he's waiting outside! No one followed you here! Shoot then, shoot! It's the only way of knowing, If you're still alive 5 minutes after the shot... He'll hear the shot. You're buying time. No, Jérôme. Don't move, I'll be back. Is there someone there? Frainaud? I'm not scared of you, Frainaud! I'm sorry, he forced me to call you. I know, I know... - We can't get out. - There must be a way. Quick, take the helmet. - Put your helmet on. - Why? Put it on, I said! But that way's the cliff! It's our only chance to escape! I can't do it. Don't worry, 5 meters left, I'll spot you. We just need to get there, I'll fix the rope and we'll go down. - Go! - It's too high! It's like the training. Don't worry, let's go. Go, quickly! Come back! There we go. You have to be crazy to do that, especially with a child! Answer me! Do you hear me? Laura, answer me! Don't worry, he can't see us. You're making me angry. Go on, trust me. Look at me, everything's gonna be O.K. Laura, come back! I'll let you two go, I promise. I'll leave you alone, alright? Laura, I won't hurt you. Can you hear me? I won't hurt you! Come back! Oh well, you're making this easier for me. This will fix things with your psycho. An accident while trying to get to the boarder, that's what they'll say when they see you and the rifle. Did you see the rifle? If you don't want to fall like that, come back. Don't make me do this! He's shooting us! It's O.K., he can't see us. It's over, huh? Of course it's not over, it's just gonna be a little harder. We'll try to get to the closed path, O.K.? Then it'll be easier, the path is traced. Wait I'm gonna rope you, Anticipate my next step, right? Right! Answer me, Laura! You two are dead! You wanna do it without rope! I'm going! Good-bye, Laura! Good-bye, did you hear? Mommy! Don't move! Try to hold onto the mountain! Don't worry, it's Gilles, everything's O.K. There's a flat part lower down, let's go, slowly. Where is he? Up there! How's your superman? Are you O.K.? Yes, give me the gun on my belt. You can't hold it! I can't thank you enough! How did you know? You had a tag on you. I just had to activate it. Send an ambulance, with a stretcher, and a bag. You should have told me, I wanted him alive. He killed my partner! He killed one of my guys but... - Is it over? - Yes. Was Jérôme daddy's friend? No, that wasn't him. Was the Frainaud story just to throw me off? No, I thought it was him, I went out with him years ago. Forget him. - He'll never hurt you. - Why? Because your psycho's dead. At Lille. His body was burned, someone getting even. - Are you sure? - Yes, a DNA test proved it. Wanna come with me? See you at the hospital. Shall we take you? Thanks, I need to check something at home first. We'll say your radio wasn't working. Have a good recovery. Thank you, captain! "Identity not revealed. "Victim burned alive before they got there. "No suspects have been arrested... ... getting even. "... delicate case." So? Did you save your son? Yes, he's fine. Thank you. That's great, you were luckier than I was. Why, what happened? I couldn't help him, he deserved help. Look at his smile, such a smile. That's your grandson's picture! No, my son, my only son. It was taken a few year ago. You don't know him? How should I... Concentrate, look closely. Frédéric? Yes. It's the boy your boyfriend burned because he hit on you. It's just so you can sleep, you need to rest. No, thanks, I'll sleep just fine without it, I'll be fine. I'm not as brave as you... Actually, I take back what I said that day. About what? Climbing. It is a man's sport. Thank you. That's the first time you say something nice. You saved my mother. Are you in love with her? Yes. Good. Now you can get married, and she'll be happy. It's a little bit more complicated than that. She'd have to be in love with me too. Actually, has she talked about me since I left? Alright... Nicolas, I... I love her. What a day! Is Denis Saron here? Yes, I saw him at radiology, he wanted to thank you. You saved my life. Did you see who it was? Of course, that crazy woman, and she had no reason... What crazy woman? My limp's gone, I never had one! Thanks to the ladder, you lived in fear. You had to know you would die. I tried the crossbow but I missed. It's better this way, you're gonna die like my son, and like your friend Olivier. That was you? How did you know he had escaped? I've been planning this for 10 years. I helped him escape, he thought I was in love with him. Atone for your mistakes! - May God keep your soul! - Wait! I tried to stop Olivier from killing Frédéric, I swear! You're as big of a coward as your accomplice. Before he died, he told me it was your fault. Did he tell you I gave him away? - You'll say anything to live! - It's the truth! I told the police where his hideout was, but that wasn't published. Anonymously, that way no one can verify. Superintendent Lorgon, that's who I spoke to. June 8th, in the morning. Call him. Even if that were true, you were there when they tortured him. And I have nightmares about it every night. I wasn't strong enough. I didn't want to die. If I hadn't been pregnant, I would've been braver, but he still would have died. You have to believe me! But you're right, it was my fault, Frédéric was in love with me, so he tried to save my life, that's why he died. My son was an angel. His father died when he was 12 and I didn't know how to raise him, he was so kind... - Laura, are you O.K.? - Yes, I'm fine! I was gonna call you. I killed Olivier Frainaud. A premeditated murder that I don't regret at all. How is Laura involved? She's not. You don't need me anymore. Good, bravo! I'm not scared anymore. Me neither. I think I'll win the Valley Cup by default. You may just lose the next one. I'll train all year long. A sabbatical? No, I'm quitting, I stop working at the end of the month. - What will you do? - Mountain guide. Cool! That way you can... Where? That depends on a series of things. I talked to Rachel, she still refuses to tell us why she wanted to kill you. It has something to do with Frainaud, no? Did you come to interrogate me? Stop beating around the bush and ask me directly. Well, Laura... - Will you marry me? - Yes! I want you to be her husband! You're a miracle worker!
