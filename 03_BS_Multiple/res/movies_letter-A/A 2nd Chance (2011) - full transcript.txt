You still have exquisite control despite not doing gym for years. Bev. No my time is well and truly past... But I do love coaching. - Well, that's what I wanted to... talk to you about. - Very good handstand Emma. I was hoping you could take over coaching the level 6 gymnasts for me? I couldn't possibly. Why can't you continue? Oh well, you know... I've not been well and I have to have a few tests done. Plus the girls need someone younger, they need someone who... can devote more time and energy to them than I can. I would love to help. But I just couldn't. I understand. But you'll have to deal with it one day. Sorry Bev. I'm sorry girls. She can't. What's the matter with you? Is it because of me she won't coach? - Oh, Maddy, no, it's nothing like that, it's just... [Coughs] ...she has her reasons, that's all. Are you OK? - Mmmm... Yeah, I'm fine. That's it for tonight. Time to pack up and go home. I'm heading off Bev. You OK to lock up? Yeah, that's fine Kate. - See you tomorrow. [Footsteps] Doh! Bev? Bev! Bev! What is it? - I can't breathe! [Labored breathing] OK, don't panic. Bev? - Oh, Kate. Thanks for coming. How are you? I'm getting better. I can breathe now. [laughing] But... They've... they've scheduled the operation for tomorrow. Wow! That's better sooner than later, get you back to normal. I'm sorry to ask again, but could you please... ... look after and train the level 6 girls for me? Of course. How can I refuse now? [Laughing] But only until you're better, ok? OK. Thank you Kate. Thank you. OK. Erin? Kayla, Maddy? Lets see what you can do on the floor. Really, really good girls. Maddy...just focus on your own moves and you'll be terrific. How've have you been going in the competitions? Winning easily? Us? You must be joking! We get caned by Saints every time. Saints huh? They were never any good in my day. We'll have to see about that. Come on. We've got work to do. Guess what's first lesson today for Kayla? Hmm... Let me think. You know exactly what it is. Wild Guess... Dance? I hate dance! I never get the moves right. At least it's your last lesson today. Yes! Fortunately. Did I tell you that I hate dance? Yes. Constantly! So, What do you think of our new coach Miss Kate Jones? Really good girls... She's alright I guess. What about you Maddy? I liked her. I reckon she'll put in for us. She's only doing it for Bev. She'll drop us as soon as Bev's OK. Yeah, I guess. Oh-oh.... Hi girls. Coming to the State Championships on the weekend? What's it to you? You're going, aren't you Maddy? Yeah, we all are. Great! You girls are so hopeless you make us look more fantastic! If that's possible. Right Girls? One day I'm gonna show her. - Show her what? Just show her. Nearly Maddy. Try it again. You can do it! It's no use. I'm not good enough! Maddy, try it again. This time, when you get to here, use the momentum to push. Don't hold back. Now push! There see. You're nearly there. OK. Now we're going to finish off on your floor routines. Erin, Maddy let's go. [Music] Real good Erin. Real good. That's it. Keep it tight. OK Maddy. Your turn. Remember don't hold back. Just focus and go for it! [Music] [Clapping] Great Maddy! That's it! Believe in yourself. Competition tomorrow, hey girls? Should be interesting. Never quite feel you're prepared. Does anyone need a ride? What, all three of you? Don't your parents come? My mum and dad aren't really interested. My mum and dad normally come and we always take Erin... ... but tomorrow they're going to my brother's sports day. That's rides for 2 of you. What about you Maddy? My dad always comes but he has to work. He'll pop in later though. OK. What about your mum? My mum died when I was eight. Sorry, Maddy. Yeah. Me too. [Music] Really stretch out. Straight backs. Straight backs. Straight backs on the way down. Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Round 1 of the women's gymnastics competition. [Clapping] Please welcome the judges for today with supervising head judge Sally Peterson. [Clapping] Mr Peterson, the prognosis is not good. The concussion will pass in a few days. We still need to do some testing but I have to tell you... ... it doesn't look good. [Crying] Hey, Sally. Kate's here. Come on in, Kate. [Crying] Get out! Get out! I don't want to see her! I never want to see her again. [Crying] [Crying] It's not fair! Kate! We're Starting, it's this way, C'mon! Alright. C'mon. Go. [60's surfie music] [Blurgh] [Clapping, music throughout competition] Do your dismount. [Clapping] It's OK. You've still have the floor to do yet. [Clapping] - That was so good! - Unbelievable! Everyone's like, Oh my god! The dance was just perfect. Just brilliant. [Clapping] That was fantastic! Really? Truly? Oh yeah! Gold medal material! 12.8?... That's crap! Erin! 12.8?... 4th?... What is this? [Clapping] Hey, girls... congratulations. You did it again. Told you all that training would pay off. It's good to see you. Well done congratulations! Hey, Good job with your team. Last girl was a little unlucky. Unlucky? Sally's a damn cheat. Whoa, whoa, Sally's one of the top judges. What would you know? Bev! Are you OK? Should you be here? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I just wanted to get out for a bit and Maddy's dad was kind enough to pick me up and bring me down here. Oh. Did you see what Sally did to Maddy? After all these years! Maybe she can't forgive me, but to take it out on Maddy? I'm determined to find a way for Maddy to win. Even with Sally's Bias. I've got to train the girls better than the other teams. Does this mean you'll keep coaching them? Oh, the girls are OK, and I don't mind coaching. Now with Sally... I'm not going to let her beat me. Well you'll need assistance from a top coach. You should ask Shane Fuller. He is a strength and technique coach. Great idea! Do you have his number? No need. He's... He's just over there. Oh no! Why? What happened? Don't ask. I'm too embarrassed. Are you sure he's that good? Probably no one better. [Sigh] Alright... here goes. -[Chuckles] [Background chatter] Hey, great job on your judging again, Sally. Gee, you were lucky to get the silver with that seasick routine of yours, Maddy's was really good! Maddy's was good! Better than Chelsea's. Hey Maddy? Gee, that was a great floor routine. Thanks? Even with your best performance all you could manage was 4th? Why don't you just do yourself a favor and quit? The closest thing that you'll get to a medal is that metal in your mouth. [knock at door] [Door Opens] You OK? Yeah. Just the kids at school are making fun of me again. I wish I was more like the other kids. I know other kids can be mean. I'm so proud of you though. And you know? You're so like your mum. If she was here well I know she'd just be beaming with pride. I miss her so much dad. Me too kiddo. Me too. Come on girls! Stick with it, Maddy. Kate, why won't you reconsider getting Shane in? It would really help you and the girls! Nope. I can do it on my own. Why not take this weekend off, come and watch the boys competition? I mean, if you won't ask for help you might as well pick up some pointers by watching. Maddy! Really! Can't you stick to your own area? Actually, we could use a break. The girls are really struggling. Especially Maddy. They told me how Chelsea ripped into her. Ohh. OK. Take a break. C'mon. Let's go for a drink. [Music throughout competition] See the strength? And the technique? Yeah, I see it! Look, there's Shane. You could still ask him for help! - No! Bev, no! - Shane? Smile! Shane? Hello, Shane. - Hi, Beverly. Your boys are performing very well. Yeah, so far so good. It's not over yet though. This is Kate Jones. - Nice to meet you. Haven't we met before? No. Well we sort of crossed paths at the last competition. Yes. Now I remember. - Um Kate wanted to speak to you. Yeah I was... I was wondering if, maybe... Look, I'll help you. -You will? Yeah sure, look. It's just a small thing. It just happened. Don't worry about it. I accept your apology. Apology? Apologize? Well, that's what you we're going to ask wasn't it? Last time we met you were insulting towards Sally as I remember? No. Sally? Well, I think you're the one who owes the apology. [Laughs] I don't see what for? Look, I've got to get back to the competition. Another time maybe. That went well. Conceited, arrogant, prat! Thanks a lot for that! It's not my fault you can't talk to a man. [Clapping] Yeah! So proud of you boys! Good work today! So, did you enjoy that? I am glad we went. Yes. It's good to see the way they deal with things. You're right as always. - Oh no. I've left my bag behind. One of the girls will get it for you. Girls? - No! no... It's fine. Are you sure? Yes! Go ahead, get the car and meet me back here. OK. Shane! Hey, Beverley. How are you? I meant to ask you before. Oh, I'm getting better, just one day at a time. Hey, congratulations on the win today. Ah, the boys did it. It wasn't me. [Chuckle] I think you're being a little modest. I was wondering if you could help our girls team with specialized training? Well sure, but isn't Kate in charge? Oh, yes, yes she is. and she's doing a terrific job, It's just that. the girls need some extra strength and technique training. And Kate was keen to ask you but after her little altercations with you. now she feels she can't. You mean today and at the girls gym? [Chuckle] Ah, tell her it was nothing. Tell her to forget about it. Sure. I'll help. Yeah! Look at that form! One more for good luck. That's beautiful! This time I want to see your full run up with a half twist through the air, OK? Yeah, Maddy, nice and strong. Beautiful momentum through that run up. This time I want you to go through your full run up and then go into a full twist while you're in the air, OK? A layout backsault with a full twist? I could never do that! - Oh, I reckon you could. You've got everything. Everything you've just done alright? So you've got your arms, and then head. C'mon, Maddy. - C'mon. Go for it girl. - GFG! GFG? Go for it girl. GFG! - Oh yeah! Sweet! C'mon, Maddy. -C'mon. GFG! GFG! GFG! GFG! GFG! GFG! GFG! Woah! -Maddy! Maddy, are you OK? Maddy, that was a lay out backsault with nearly a full twist! I haven't been able to get you to do a 1/2 twist let alone the full one! How on earth? Oh, now it all makes sense. Let me guess. Beverley asked you here yesterday, right? Yeah. Can he help us? - He wants to. Please? - Please, Please, Please? - He wants to help us. Alright. - Yes! I just hope Shane knows what he's in for! Yes! Yes! Yes! Thank you! Alright. Careful, careful! Alright. No more full twists OK? Right, back to it. You're going to have to rest that for a week! Finish off with some floor exercises. That's good. Nice and strong. Yeah, Maddy, you can sit out. Nice and straight, nice and strong. Beautiful. OK, straight into dish. Quick! One... Two... - OK. That'll do for today. Wow, look the girls are really good. Especially Maddy. Yeah, they are good. I think Maddy's exceptional. She just lacks confidence. Do you think I could bring my boys around & combine training? That way I'd get more time with them. That sounds really good! I mean, whatever will help the girls. I really want them to win the next comp. - Yeah. Oh. Here they are. [Inaudible whispering, and laughing] Alright, girls, let me introduce my boys team. This is Matthew. This is Harrison. And this is Joshua. Duh! They are our friends on Facebook. Erin, manners please. Well sorry. But they are friends and Josh goes to our school. So we do know them. - Of course! Facebook! Starting out with warm-up stretches. In a line facing each other. And arm swings. - Feet nice and close together. C'mon Josh, you know this. Nice and tight up through the body. Left arm... Good. [Crickets] [Sigh] Shane. Hi. - Kate. Hi, what time is it? Oh, yeah, it is a bit late. Yeah. What's up anyway? Um. Well, there's only 2 weeks to the next competition. Can I met with you to discuss the girls' progress? Is that all you rang for? Yeah, but only if it's over dinner. Well, fine. But I get to pick the restaurant. Deal! Tomorrow night at 6:00? Great, I'll text you where to meet me. Thanks. Ahh. This is not exactly what I had in mind. Yeah, I suspected what you had in mind, which is why I chose here. Oh really? What did I have in mind? Here, I've ordered for you. So. What can we do to give the girls a real edge? Well, to advance they need strength development. Aha. I know you can get it out of the boys apparatus. We could train them on the boys equipment? That's a bit radical. Has it worked in the past? - I don't know! I've never done it before. [Laughing] The boys equipment!?! Yes. The boys equipment. Now boys, this is all about helping the girls. Matthew, you're with Kayla. Harry, you're with Erin. And Josh, you're with Maddy. Alright. Let's get into it. Did I mention you are all teams? Whoever does the most chin ups, pull ups on the rings, and dips on the bars will win the prize. What's the prize? You are direct aren't you? I want to know what the prize is if I'm gonna have to work with him! Rest assured, it will be good. - It better be. C'mon. Prize? When did you come up with that? When none of them moved. I've got no idea what to use as a prize. -[laughter] It shouldn't be hard, yeah? Well, if you can do it it can't be that hard. Whoops! Argh! Tst. [Doorbell] [Doorbell] Yes? Is... Is Maddy at home? Maybe. Who might you be? I'm Joshua. I'm helping Maddy at the gym. Hmm. May I please speak to Maddy? Sure. Come on in. I'll get Maddy for you. Josh! What are you doing here? I think that's pretty obvious! He's come to see you kiddo. Spruce yourself up! Don't want to look like the cat dragged you in. Well, I've got some things to do out in the out in the shed. Nice to meet you Joshua. I'll be out in the garage if you need me, Maddy. You done your homework yet? Yeah, that was easy. I love working out those problems in my head. Really? - You? I'm pretty hopeless. I could sort of help you a bit. - Oh cool... I'll go get my books. Sorry. Ouch! Well, I was gonna use my head. But not quite like that! [Inaudible chatter] Well, what do you reckon Hunter? Hey? Have we given them enough time? C'mon. Let's go. Could you really not work this out? I just got a bit confused alright? It's full reception. Don't be mean. How's it going guys, alright? - Yep... Fine dad. Yeah, good, Mr Cornell. So, what are you working on? - It's actually very interesting. Did you see Josh is with that little cow Maddy? Nuh. Who? What? Maddy and Joshua Phelps. Well, Joshua Phelps. Like, who cares? I do! I'm gonna teach her a lesson. Don't you sit next to him in IT? - Yeah. I want you to swap with me. What are you doing? Catherine sits there. - Oh, I asked to swap. I hoped you could help me with the assignment. You? As if you need help. Well this web stuff's too hard for me. How do you get pictures in it? That's easy. You just-- Thank you for your help, Josh. - That's alright. What are you doing? Did she see? - Oh, yeah, big time! She ran off behind the classroom. Sucks to be her! What's up with you today? What's up with her? She saw you with Chelsea! That was nothing. I just helped her! Well getting her to kiss you isn't nothing! It's not my fault. I didn't do anything! You know Chelsea hates Maddy? - Says who? Don't you get it? She'll do any thing to have a go at Maddy. No she wouldn't, she's not like that at all. I don't care about Maddy. I think Chelsea really likes me. Yeah, Chelsea really likes you...Not! It's different now! She knows me. Yeah right, sure. Nice, Harry. Nice and strong through those shoulders sets. Josh and Maddy didn't seem to be getting on. Did you notice? Can't say that I did. Yeah, nice, Josh, that's it. Keep that sustained. Have you got the invite? Yes, I have it. - Mum? Dad? You'll be coming down today won't you? Of course we will darling but we have to go to your father's business lunch first. You'll come down straight after? Yes, we'll try. They're not coming are they? [Music] C'mon, Kayla! GFG! GFG! GFG! GFG! [Music throughout routine] Well done, Kayla. Go, Erin! GFG GFG. - Go, Erin! GFG, Erin! GFG, GFG. C'mon, Erin! C'mon, Erin, keep it tight! Show it off. That was so good. -Well done. Alright, Maddy? - C'mon, Maddy! GFG! C'mon, Maddy! Keep it tight! - GFG! No. Well done, Maddy! Congratulations gymnasts. Well done! [Audience applause] Thank you, gymnasts. We have with us today a special guest. Tom Johansson from the National Selectors Committee. Let's welcome Tom. [Applause] Thank you. What a fantastic competition that's been here today! With some very talented gymnasts. That brings me to the reason why I'm here. The national selectors will be appointing the winning gymnast in the next competition straight into the national squad. Also, I have some good news for the judges and, in particular, your very own Sally Peterson. Come forward, Sally. There's a vacancy on the International judges panel. And I'm pleased to announce Sally has been nominated to be our representative. So, congratulations Sally, and thank you everyone. [Applause] See you in round 3. Sally, can I speak to you afterwards if that's OK? Sure. That little witch Maddy. She isn't that good at all. Yeah. That little witch Maddy, she isn't even that good at all. God! - What? Makes me so mad! Maddy won that medal fair and square! Saints? As if! You know? They do look like winners though. I think it's time we had an extreme make over. What? C'mon, let's go find Beverley! So, to get endorsement into the national committee three members will assess your judging They judge you and gymnasts and compare scores. Yes and I have to be within .2 of their score to be nominated. Correct. But there is one other problem. Problem? What's that? Someone's lodged a complaint against you. A complaint? What about? Bias judging. What! I can't believe it! We can't endorse your nomination whilst this complaint is lodged. Who lodged it? You know I can't say until the hearings been set. I can't imagine who would do this? Can you tell me who? - You know I can't tell you. You know those are the procedures. However, it would be better if it just went away. Tom, this is my whole future. There's Beverley and who's the other coach? Kate Jones isn't it? Didn't Kate and you used to be good friends? You could say that. Pity you're not all good friends now isn't it? Kate Jones! I want to speak to you! Sally? You made a complaint against me of my judging of your precious little protege Maddy Cornell? Sally. I didn't. But I should. Kate. Don't lie to me now. You lied when I had the accident in the gym. Don't lie to me again. I didn't. It wasn't my fault. Yes it was. You pushed me. The pit's been emptied so be careful not to go near it, OK? I had my hand on your shoulder. You were holding on to me. We were having such good fun. No you won't. Then you fell. You slipped. I don't know. I just can't remember. You may not remember but I sure do. Because I live with it every day. If you try and destroy my future I'll make sure your little protege's future is destroyed too! What? You wouldn't. Not to Maddy? - Just try me! Kate? What was that all about? It's the accident. She still blames me. I think I pushed her. Shh. You said you couldn't remember what happened. I know. I can't but Sally does. She said I pushed her. Oh, Kate. Shh. I'm sure if you had, you would have remembered. I don't know. I just... I don't know! Blow. That's a good girl. - [Crying Giggle] Try not to think about Sally. You should be thrilled with how the girls went today. Especially Maddy. Two silvers, not bad, hey? - Yeah and the winner goes straight into the national team! Woo-hoo! I think that's reserved for Chelsea. I don't know, if you take Sally's bias out of it. It's a very close thing. Do you think? - Aha. Don't give up on her now. Anything could happen. Yeah, I guess. Something troubling Maddy though. I don't know. I can't quite pinpoint it. Good, Kayla. OK. That's it for today girls. Really good today girls. Really, really good. Now, home and relax, you deserve it. Hey, Maddy? I think it's time we shared the joy of Maddy's puppy love with the whole school. Maddy has a puppy? I love puppies! No. Catherine. Beccy. Same as last time, we'll get all the year 7's to watch Maddy's face when I kiss Josh. But? Haven't we done enough to her? Beccy. The next comp winner will get into the national squad do you think I'm gonna give her a chance at that? But! - Now! What about the puppy? Maddy wait up. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. You've been acting so funny lately. I thought winning the silver would snap you out of it. I've just had other things on my mind. If you don't want me around I'll go hang with Chelsea. Fine. You do that. [Inaudible chatter] [Student laughter] What are you trying to do? Nothing that concerns you but you played your part well! I didn't do anything! I thought we were friends? You and me? I don't think so. I'm not desperate! You just used me to hurt Maddy? - You're the sucker! I bet you set this up as well. All just to get at Maddy? What has she ever done to you? - That's not the point. You are so up yourself Chelsea! Who'd wanna be with you? I don't and no one else would either! It's no wonder your parents never want to be with you. Mum? Mum? Dad? Gran? Mum? Dad? I'm quitting! You can't do that. I've worked so hard. I mean we have done too much work for you to quit! The final competition and the National Squad? Not now! Maddy! - Kate! Why don't you want her to quit? Is it for her benefit or yours? Maddy? [Knock at door] Maddy, may I come in? Wow. A gold medal? Look at the inscription. Equal first place, Kate Jones Under 12, National Championships? Who'd you come equal with? Sally Peterson. Is she the judge in the wheelchair? Yeah, that's right. We were both heading towards representing our country. Then Sally had her accident and could never compete again. Out of sympathy to her I decided never to compete again either. The girls and I always wondered. Is that why you didn't want to coach us? Yeah. Sort of. Now. It's your choice whether you quit or not. And I have to admit coaching you has given me a second chance to see a dream fulfilled. But I don't want you to be like me and make a wrong decision. Quit for the right reasons. You know I see you look at yourself. I see you feel like you're not like the other kids. I'm telling you Maddy. Your talent, your physique, most of all your heart means that you are 10 times more talented than Chelsea and all her friends put together. Quit if you want to. But don't be like me and waste your talent because of what others think. What about the medal? Keep it. That's right. Swapping over. Good. And shoulder stretch. I think we both should have a second chance. Go on then! Maddy? Maddy! Maddy, wait up. I realize I was wrong! I shouldn't have made fun of you like that. What are you doing now, Chelsea? Still trying to milk more fun out of it? No, I was trying to apologize. Maddy? Sorry about yesterday. I didn't know! Spare me the details. I saw what happened. But I didn't mean to hurt you. - Well, you did! And I don't want you around anymore. I told Kate and Shane I don't want you at training either. But it wasn't my fault! Maddy? Maddy? Maddy? Maddy? What you doing, buddy? Ahhh, glutton for more punishment, eh? I heard what you said to Chelsea after her stunt. Good for you! Doesn't do me any good, Maddy won't even talk to me. Come back after training tonight. I'll talk to her. OK? You'd help? Sure. I'll be back. Maddy? Maddy. Even if you're right you still have to forgive and move on. But! Did you know he gave Chelsea a serve after you left? No. Erin and Kayla said something, but I didn't listen. Well, from what they told me that boy deserves a gold medal. Um. Do you want to walk me home? - Sure! Forgive and move on, or you just hurt yourself. Let me guess. Good advice for me and Sally. It would be good for the both of you. I mean, for what it's worth. Well, whatever happens next comp, I'll try and patch things up. It won't solve this complaint against her though. What do you mean? She blames me for a complaint lodged against her. That's what our argument was about. I thought you said it was about the accident. Well yeah that too. But it was the complaint that started it off. Oh dear. Don't you worry about it. I'll just have to sort it out with her anyway. I think I could do with a dose of that advice myself. You lodged the complaint? - Shh! I saw what she was doing to Maddy and it wasn't fair. And I couldn't stand by and do nothing. Oh Beverley! This whole time she's been blaming me and it was you! Oh, I'm sorry Kate. I thought I was doing the right thing. It's fine. - Really? I sort of didn't mind her harsh judging of Maddy. I mean, I hated it and it made me really angry but it was actually very motivating. Pushed me & Maddy beyond what I thought we were capable of. A silver lining to a dark cloud. Yeah, you're lucky. - [Chuckle] What are we gonna do? I'll make things right. One... two... three... and turn. Beautiful. One... two... And turn back. Yes... [Phone ringing] - Hello. - Shane, it's me. - Kate. - I've been doing some thinking about the girls. And there's only 3 weeks until the next comp. And I want to talk to you about them but not in front of them. - OK... Where? I don't mind. Hmm. OK but only if I pick the place! Great. This is cozy. - I take it you approve? Well, I'm not adverse to intimacy and class. I can see that. You look fantastic! Thank you. How can we improve the girls chances at the next comp? I thought that's what we were training for? Well, yeah of course it is, but now I can actually see them winning. OK. Um. Are they all doing extra skills on the apparatus? Well yeah, as many as they can but Maddy's struggling with her kips move. Erin with her run up for vault. Kayla with footwork on beam. Well, Maddy could do a layout backsault with a full twist. for an extra .5 on her floor routine? True, but she sprained her ankle and was out for a week. the last time she attempted that. - Hmm. - Maddy's kips. Erin's vault and Kayla's footwork? I've got an idea. [Clears throat] Hey, yeah, it's Shane, yeah, long time. I know this is short notice but I was wondering if... Alright. It's set. What's set? - Uh, no, no, no, no, no... That's a surprise! Be at the athletic stadium at 7:00 am. with the girls, if you dare. Now, let's talk about you for a change. [Chatter] The beam? - Excuse me! The beam is-- Is that right? - Yes! And men don't do it because-- - I bet you I could! Come on. You'll fall off! - Let me show you. Oh my god, this is so embarrassing. There's people watching! No. Lengthen. Up! Very nice. - Dismount? Ohh, very good--and extend. Well done. They liked you. - Yeah? What'd you think? Um. I'd give you another six years! Kate? What are we doing here? [Phone rings] I'm about to find out. - Kate, are you there? - Yes. We're here. What's happening? - OK. If you look around there should be an athlete waving toward you? I see her. - Put me on speaker. Girls, this is Tamsyn Lewis. Australian champion runner who's been to the Olympics and World Championships! This is especially for you, Erin! Fantastic! That's great! - Hi, girls! You must be Kate? Yes. I've spoken to Shane. And he wants me to help you with speed and acceleration. Let's go and work on some technique. Now sprinters focus on using their arms to generate speed. They pump their arms up and down and they focus on driving out. On your marks. Set. Go! Let's go again, remembering what I've taught you. Erin, that's really good. We're gonna have to move your cone back, you're much faster! Set. Kate, they're doing very well. I reckon there's one more thing that would help. Resistance training. [Phone ringing] - Shane? Kate? Now for Maddy's kip. Tomorrow meet me at my mate's warehouse. What are we doing here? Aww. Box off, box on. Who does he think he is? Mr. Miyagi I think? Who? Mr Ho to you! Who? [Sigh] Girls. This is Dean Lukin! Australia's only Gold medalist in the Olympics for weight lifting! Cool! Do we get to do some weight lifting? Shane's explained we need to do a little bit of weight training. So, what we're gonna do, is lift some of these cartons. No! Straight arms. This is gonna be hard. After a week? More than you know. Oh, Maddy? Straight arms. GFG! OK, girls, that should about do it! Alright. To the gym. Let's put it to the test. What? Now? - No time like the present. OK, Maddy. Let's see your kip. Now? My arms are dropping off. Yes. Now! Kate? You heard the man. Let's go. Maddy, I'm serious. One swing, then into kip, ok? Wow! - Did you see that. [Laughter]. Great, Maddy! This time, try again and connect your handstand. Wow! That was amazing! - That was so amazing! Nice one, Shane! OK. Now for my next miracle, Kayla's footwork. [Whispers] Where? Where tell us! C'mon! It's a secret. Not telling! [Waltz Music] Now, these are for you. These are boots. They have solid toes too? They're called steel caps, and trust me, you'll need them. So, this is Kayla our troubled footwork gymnast. Work your magic! Hopefully not too many injuries. I'm sure we'll be fine. -[laughs] He's got boots on as well? - Yes. For his protection! Good luck, Chris. Sorry... oh... - It's OK. Sorry! Oops! Ahh. - Over this way. And.... And again. That's OK start again. Sorry! Wait! Can you like, slow down? Well, that's the best I can do with them in 3 weeks. I think you are a regular little miracle worker. I... I... I do have one more surprise. I thought Maddy needed something that stood out music wise for her floor routine. So I had this made for you. Oh Maddy really. [Floor routine music] Wow! What's fantastic! Can you play that again? [Music is restarted] This goes perfectly with her routine! I'll get her used to it in the morning. Just a few little changes. She's gonna love this! Did I say only 1 more surprise? I was really hoping for two. Chelsea, don't get your hopes up. They're really busy today. Girls! The warm up has started. C'mon! Off with the tops! Get into it! We'll take them off for the march on, but not before! Ohh. OK. We'll wait for the march on. But we still have to do warm up. Arm swings, c'mon! Please leave the competition area, to commence the march on. and team presentations. What was all that about? Well, together with your music. Let's just say, it's going to be a very interesting day. Welcome everyone to the deciding competition for the State Championships. [Marching Music] Teams competing today are-- Hub. Aerial. Dynamic. Seacliff. Elizabeth. Saints. And Coreega. Gymnasts to your first apparatus please. These two seats free? - Ah yeah, I think they are. It looks like Maddy and Chelsea are going to be the last to compete on the floor. The best I can work out is whoever wins the floor is gonna win the comp. [Applause] Wow! That's the highest score for a level 6 on the floor! That's gonna be hard to beat! Oh no. This is not good. - What's the matter, Shane? Hold on a minute. - Shane?! Kate! Kate! Kate! Kate! Maddy's base score won't give her enough points to beat Chelsea. She needs a bonus skill. What's the score difference? She needs at least a .5 bonus. There's not much we can do about it now. Do the layout backsault, with a full twist. That would give her the extra point. That's too hard for her, Shane! Chelsea can't even do that! Kate? I want to do it. I reckon I can. I was so close last time. And I am so much stronger now. Maddy, are you sure? You can do it, Maddy. OK. Maddy, Maddy. GFG! GFG, Maddy! GFG? [Music] Yes! Brilliant Maddy Brilliant! [Audience cheer] Is she equal with Chelsea? - Yep! It all comes down to Sally's score now. Here's Sally's. [Clapping] [Whispering] What does that X mean? I haven't seen that before? It's some sort of error. [Whispering] Congratulations gymnasts. Well done. Great competition. Tom Johansson is here to do the presentations. Tom? Thank you. Get straight into it shall we? In 3rd place, actually we've got two equal 3rd's today! From Saints, Catherine Sims. And from Coreega, Erin Bishop! Well done girls. [Applause] And in overall 2nd place, plus gold medal for beam and vault. Chelsea Smith. [Applause] Well done. 1st place, with the highest score ever achieved for floor in level 6, plus two gold medals for floor and bar... Maddy Cornell. Well done, girls. As promised, the winner of today has automatic inclusion onto the national squad. So congratulations Maddy on winning that place. Now I also announce that your very own Sally Peterson has been accepted onto the international gymnastic judging panel! Well done, Sally. [Whispers] Your attention please. Tom the chairman of national selectors has a very special announcement. Tom? Thank you. As I mentioned before Maddy Cornell has won her place onto the squad. I also have the discretion of adding an extra gymnast to the squad as well. I'm pleased to announce with an outstanding performance. all year round. We would like to add Chelsea Smith to the squad as well. [Applause] - Congratulations, Chelsea! And thank you everyone. Chels. Chelsea! Chelsea! Thank you judges, gymnasts, parents and friends. That concludes today's competition. [Applause] They saw my 8 as a 3! Oh dear! Now girls, enough of this between you two. You're going to become team mates and you're going to behave like it, or I'll make sure you're both kicked off the team. I don't think she has the authority to do that. You and I both know that. But they don't. I'm sorry for being mean to you and Joshua and all that. Sorry for being rude to you. [Chuckles] The national squad! Both of us! Hey kiddo. Yeah, here she is. Give it up. It was my fault. - It was my fault. No, it was mine. - It was mine. Kate, let me speak first. I was the one that made up that game on the beam. And how we were pushing each other off. And I didn't even remember until the other day that my foot slipped. I think it has just been easier to blame somebody else than myself and of course that someone was gonna be you. Oh, Sally. - I'm sorry. I won't be needing this. Got my own. Yeah! My little champion! C'mon girls, yeah! Beautiful girls. Keep going. Keep the routine going. Maddy's on the tele. Come here you. C'mon! Maddy's on the T.V! We move to the final rotation. I can see Maddy Cornell just waiting to be introduced. Representing Australia, Maddy Cornell! Maddy has an amazing story. After her first regional state championships a short time ago, she's now at the world junior championships and this performance for the gold medal. Maddy presents and takes up her start position on the floor. Unbelievable! She started with a triple twist and landed it! No one will beat her now!
