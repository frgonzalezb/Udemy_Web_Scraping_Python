Hello. - Yes, tell me. - I'm Danny. Danny, right. We've been expecting you. - First month, upfront. - Okay. Three, four, five, six... And if you ever come short, you can always tell me, there's always work that needs to be done around here, so... Have a nice stay. You have to be here every night from 7 p.m. to 8 a.m. If you're not, the judge in charge of your case will be notified immediately and you will be sent back to jail. If you find work, call us and we will change the time. Any questions ? No. Leave the door open, please. That guy you were talking to, he just got out of jail, right ? Yes. Do you think he knows dad ? - I don't think so. - Why ? Because he doesn't speak French. - Yes, but he was in prison. - Yes, so what ? There is more than one prison in this country. Do you have news from dad ? No. - So you are not visiting him ? - Yes, on Monday. Are you serious ? Why didn't you tell me ? Because I didn't know. You didn't know you'd see him on Monday ? They just called to tell me I could go see him. - They just called you ? - This morning. Okay, I'm coming with you. - No. - Why not ? - You can't. - But I haven't see him in 3 months ! It's not possible. It's complicated right now, they keep moving him from one cell block to another. He doesn't want to see me anymore, is that it ? No sweety, it's not that. You should him a letter. I don't want to write him a fucking letter. I just want to see him. Finish your plate. - Hi. - You want to smoke ? - I can't. - Why ? Because my mom would know the minute I get through the door. But if you want to slide me a little weed for later, that's cool. And what's in it for me ? You'll suck me off ? - Are you sick or what ? - It's OK, I'm just messing with you. But you can give me a kiss at least. Hi ! Got a cigarette ? Clara. Come and help me. How's your room ? It's fine. Thank you. Good. Clean the dishes. That thing you said yesterday... What kind of job is it ? - You need to redo the whole room. - Why ? Otherwise you have to repaint it every six months. If you buy the material, I'll do it for you. - You know how to do it ? - Yeah, I do. How much ? - Two months' rental. - One. Okay. - You take it back ? - Yeah, I got it. I'm gonna walk back. - You know the way ? - I'll find it. Okay. Hey, what are you doing ? Why you won't talk to me ? You're too shy or what ? Oh, come on ! Where're you going ? Going out for lunch ? - Can I come with you ? - No. Why ? Please ! I'm starving. My mom's not here. I have nothing to eat. I'm gonna die. Because of you. Can you keep your mouth shut ? I don't know... Yeah ! Where're you from ? I know, you're from Denmark. I know you were in prison. Well, I know a lot about you. So why do you keep asking ? My dad says you never ask people why they went to prison. Well, you should listen to your dad then, huh ? He's not around. You know Tony Janssens ? No. He's my dad. He's in prison too. In Forest. I'm not allowed to visit him. I don't know why, but... whenever my mom goes, she comes up with some excuse not to bring me. I think she doesn't want me to see him anymore. Or maybe he's the one who doesn't want to see me, I don't know. But... I don't get it. It's not fair, I'm his daughter, you know. Well, it's not easy seeing your family when you're inside. - You shouldn't judge him. - I'm not judging him. I just want to see him. You got kids ? No. Why ? You don't like kids ? You didn't want them ? - Or you're just too old ? - I thought we had an agreement. You talk too much. You know that ? You got a cigarette ? For me ? Please ? - You want it ? - Yeah. Take it. You got it. Hello ! - Can I help you ? - I'm looking for a job. Wait here. - Look at the dog. - Yes, he's dirty. He comes around every day. - What are you doing ? - Just trying to pet him. - He's not gonna let you. - Why ? Oh fuck ! - You see ? I told you. - Why doesn't he let me pet him ? Cause he doesn't trust you. - Hi. - Hey ! My daughter told me you took her out to lunch. Yeah. Your daughter told me she was starving. Well, she... Can you stop that, please ? So we can talk ? My daughter likes to play games. Okay ? Don't get into it. Please. I'm not into little girls. I prefer women my own age. Good. I'll pay you back the meal. I don't want your money. Then we have a problem. - Why ? - Cause I don't wanna owe you anything. You're finished ? - Want me to help you ? - It's fine. She talks about her dad as if he is some kind of hero. Isn't that normal ? All kids think their parents are heroes. Maybe. What else did she tell you ? That she can't visit her dad. You won't let her. Prison is not a place for kids, is it ? It's only a visit. He's getting out in a few months, so... You don't seem so excited about that. He's leaving me. For a younger woman. Some teacher he met in a prison program. You think that's funny ? No sorry, it's just... I've heard that story before. The convict and the teacher. Kind of a classic. Don't tell her, okay ? She doesn't know. I won't. That's not my business. Here it is. The machine is not working, so you have to do everything yourself. You're good ? Okay, good luck then. Hey ! I thought you might be hungry. Thanks. Next time, eat with us before the rush. It's better. Actually, I kinda like it out here. I'm good. What's your name ? I'm Danny. Not really into people, Danny. See you. Hey. You want a glass of wine or a beer ? - A beer would be nice, yeah. - Okay. Tough day ? - How did you end up here ? - What ? How did you end up here ? Just got out of jail. What ? That's why you're looking at me like this ? To freedom. To freedom. Fuck ! I need to go. - You're late. - Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. I got a job today. In a restaurant. It was my first day today. I told you to call us so we could adjust your hours. Yes, I know. I'm sorry. Send us the details. But if you are late again, you're back inside. Okay, I will. Thank you. Bye. - Are you all right, sweetie ? - Yes. I left you something in the fridge. Did you find it ? Yes. When are you coming back ? I'll be home late. Don't wait for me. What time ? In a couple of hours. You'll be in bed. But did he ask you about me or not ? Yes, sure. What ? Yes... What did he say... He asked me how you're doing... That's all ? No. You know, sweetie, there's... There is something I need to tell you. Daddy is not... Daddy isn't coming back. Why ? Why did he leave you ? Who is it ? Danny ! - What are you doing here ? - Get in. - Why are you here ? - You'll see. - What is it ? - Don't bust my balls, yes or no ? - Can I take it all ? - Whatever you want. It burns. So ? I can't feel anything. Yeah, sure. What is it ? What is it ? What do you think it is ? What are you doing ? Stop it. What are you doing ? No, stop it. Stop it ! - Don't touch me ! - Easy now. I said stop it ! Don't touch me ! You shut your mouth now, OK ! Shut your mouth. Let me go ! Get lost ! Come on ! We'll have to take off your clothes. You've got to help me. Put your arms up. I'm cold. Stay with me, come on ! Calm down. Be quiet, be quiet. I need you to stand up, come on ! Stand up, come on ! Yeah, get it out. Can you take off your clothes ? Throw that shit out. Okay, sit down. - Here, wash yourself with this. - Help me. You can do it. I feel dirty. Can you do it yourself ? Stand up. Don't tell my mom. Don't tell her, promise me. It's okay, come on, wash it. It's okay. Who was that guy ? - Who is he ? - Leave me alone ! Clara, you can't stay here. Please. No. My dad isn't coming back. Come on. Danny ? - Hey, Danny. - Yeah ? Did you see anything strange last night ? - No. - Did you see Clara ? She's got bruises all over. She said she got into a school fight, but I don't believe her. Hello ! - I don't know anything. - Should I go to the cops ? - Why do you want to go to the cops ? - Maybe she got assaulted. She won't talk to me. Try to be patient. Fuck away from me ! Get the fuck off me ! Fuck, fuck, fuck ! Where did you go ? This is a business, okay ? You can't just go for a walk ! Fuck ! We need to talk. The cops came. A guy got killed. They burnt his car with him inside. Do you know anything about that ? I do. That guy in the car... He raped Clara. The night you went out. How do you know ? I found her in the parking lot. Why didn't you tell me ? I made a promise. What do you mean ? I promised her not to tell. My daughter gets raped and you promise her not to tell me ? I'm her mother. You're crazy. You killed him, didn't you ? What was I supposed to do ? Let him go ? You should have gone to the cops ! When my daughter got raped, you should have gone to the cops. - I'm going... - Yeah, fine. Tell the cops. - I don't care. - Get out of my house. - I want you out ! Now ! - Stop it, please. No ! Please, calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Please, please. - Help me ! - Please. I'm sorry. Salut. You okay ? So... this is where you work ? Yeah. What happened to your hair ? - You like it ? - Yeah, that's fine. Can I go inside ? - You wanna go inside ? - Yeah. Sure. - Now ? - No, finish your cigarette. Let's go inside. What's that ? HIV test. Freaks me out. - Mind if I do it here ? - No, of course not. I can't understand this shit. Let me see. - It's in German. - Yeah. - Are they dry ? And clean ? - Yeah. Let me see your finger. - You're ready ? - Yeah. - You're sure ? - Yeah. It's nothing. Hold still. Hold still. Hold still. Don't suck it. Here, hold this. What ? I think we're good. Yeah. - Yeah ? - Yeah. - Fuck ! - You gotta go to school. How's Clara ? Better. I told her. About her father. Good. Now she hates him. I'm sure it'll pass. She doesn't need a father like that. He's the only father she's got. I feel stupid. Why ? For waiting for him all these years. Telling her he'd come home one day. Being loyal is not being stupid. I'm pretty sure he misses you now. Yeah. He bought this place for us. Had big dreams. Then he left me with all these debts. Now I'm stuck here. Stuck. You gonna go home one day ? No. There's nothing but trouble for me at home. Looks like trouble found you here. It's him ? Are you sure ? Go ! Nice kitchen, my friend. Sorry to bother you here at work. You look really busy. But we got ourselves a little problem. A guy got killed not far from here. Burnt to a crisp in his car. - Does it ring a bell ? - I don't understand French. Is he fucking with us or what ? That was my dope in the car. Now you fucking pay me ! I'm just a dishwasher around here. Get out of here ! You should be in bed now. I think I'm high. Want some ? - It's not going away. - Cover yourself ! Come on, please. - I have to leave. - Why ? If you leave, they'll send you back to jail. Don't worry about that. You're like my dad. Maybe you're right. Or maybe you're wrong. Cause there's just some people who can't... you can't control, they won't change. But that doesn't mean they don't care for you. - We need to go inside. - No, it's okay. Come on, get up. Come on ! Go inside ! Come on, here ! Stay here, be quiet ! No ! Stop crying. You're not a kid anymore. Get in. A BLUEBIRD IN MY HEART Subtitles from Queen Queen
