Go today and bring home a nice A. In life we must invest in ourselves. - Wasn't he Persian? - Persian in ancient times... According to present Romanian borders. It's a famous song in Romania, "I wasn't born for defeat... Nor does failure run in my veins. like Volare for us. What a strange language, it sounds like swearing. I'm a lion, Iwon't listen to those who cry and feel sorry for themselves It's true... it does. When actually, it's full of words of love. because it's a contagious disease.” And dedicated to you. Are you gonna tell 'em Michele, or am I, to fuck off. that promotion must be ours, we deserve it. - You know, don't you? - I know, darling. Are you gonna tell 'em, or am I, to fuck off...

And your sister! Polenta! Do I serve the whore? Yes, please serve the whore. Who? Fortuna, stick your head out, you're making crumbs. In Romanian, polenta: whor-a. It's cold, Daddy. An ancient Persian word. Sweetheart, stick your head out or stop eating. - Careful! - Apologize. I apologize, I clean, old remedy. - No need. - Saliva and a drop of wine. - What are you doing? Please ! - More saliva. - Here we are. - Bye, Daddy. Akiss! - He spit on me. - Really? I don't think so. - Vittorio, why are you grumbling? - Because I hate this school. What's he doing? Is he crazy? Bye. He's on trial. Up your asses, you bunch of jerks! Wait, Doriana! No strumpet for me! You're leaving? Too bad, I made strudel, and everyone always like it. Gocrap! Say goodbye to your uncle, he's leaving tomorrow. I wonder: who'll be the new marketing manager? The one with your creativity, courage and imagination, Excellent! Where are you going? in other words, your balls. To jail. Important news: Please, he's our only uncle. as of tomorrow, the cafeteria ham will be exclusively hand-cut. He should have thought about that. He ruined my life, now I'll ruin his. Too bad you'll miss it! Excellent, they don't know what they missed. Remember: we don't sell houses, we sell... Actually, you ruined mine first. - Chalets. - Cold. - Villas. - Dreams! Me? Could I decide anything when I was six? - Get it in your head. - Of course. Bring it in. I'd say it's an explosive metaphor. But you were older, you could decide. You could have chosen not to be a criminal. Thank you. A nest, the symbol of safety, of welcoming, of home. What do you say? Uncle defended me, you didn't. Why do you think I didn't? Interesting... What if we cut the family? For your future and your sister's, to give you what I didn't have. That's why I didn't defend you. To strengthen the nest idea? Good, Coso! Say something, Dad! I feel creative: why not cut the nest, too leaving just a blue sky with: What can I say? "Edil Manetti, your house, your dreams"? Crap? No. - We could cut the sky too. - Let's keep it, I like to be daring. Butler... A mental retard! How disgusting, he spit on me! You'll do something to that Coso, won't you?

Ma'am, what are you doing? Follow me. What's your problem? You're hurting the child. I knew it! So? No news yet, but I see some light, a nice success for the new ad campaign. Mr. Manetti didn't like last night's dinner? - The one with the nest? - Right. - Hi, sweetie! - Lice! Damn, I'll kill them off with Napalm.

"It's the DNA a marketing manager of respect must have and you, Mr. Coso, have it". You have it! And then: "Dulcis in fundo, I'd like to emphasize how likeable and lively your brother-in-law was, in the delightful butler sketch". Glad he said that! After all the work we did, we earned some luck.

Why dwell on this? Sign here, meantime, thank you. My office shows what the Manettis think of us. I see an irregularity: here it says Carmela, you can't sign Cristina. - My name's not Carmela. - Maybe you're not even Neapolitan! - That's what they all say. - The inspector. “Carmela D'Avola, born in Mezzotto, province of Naples,” Do you think it's right to promote someone who tried to murder... etc, etc... not just bruise, but murder your son!

So, welcome your uncle, whe'll be leaving on Monday. If I said: "Go fuck off", he'd answer back: "Same to you". - Fortuna. - Vittorio. -Alberico passed me his English test. -You've learned to get respect! - I'll be staying a month at least. - Sure, a year... Until the trial! Next time give him a good head butt. A pleasure. Michele. Trial? - Sit down? - No, he invited me out with friends. - I'm going out, bye. - Have fun. So, I strangled that parrot... You're in witness protection? That's why you didn't say anything, so we wouldn't worry. What a great smell! Where do you want to sit? An act of courage and a splendid example for my children. No, I'm going out. Don't I deserve an evening out with my new Giulietta? The hell I'm a witness! I'm the one on trial, ldo! they accuse me of being in the Ciciarielli clan in Mezzotto. - Have you seen my brush? - I don't use them. - Southern Italy? - Very Southern. You don't use soap either.

I really am a boss, not a jerk like you. - Fortuna, are you going out too? -Dunno! Mommy, am I going out? That's why Mom told us you were dead.

Excuse me, Debora... - Night, Uncle. - Night, Niece. Thank you. Michele, tell me something, what was your cat's name? - We don't have any cats. - You don't? Our neighbor does, Caty. - Is Ciro late? - He needs permission... - Are you okay? - A mobster's cramp. And we won't give it, so he stays with the children to increase their attachment. -Canlgo? - Get some shut-eye, I'll clean up. - So, he won't be coming? - No. Night. - Not even later? - No. I got a brother-in-law Why isn't he coming? who's a tad faggot...

That's him, he's in my bathroom. - Get him out right now! -Me? Me, I'll go. - Oh no, sorry! - Michele, c'mon in. - I don't think I should. - No formalities, we're a family.

A world of possibilities is outside, should we miss them? I mean, I don't hate it, I feel silly in a tutu. Or do you want to become like your uncle? So, the problem's not ballet, it's the tutu.

If you'd rather not take your brother into your home - Come here. - In the middle? as he awaits a preliminary hearing, that's your right. - I have something important to say. - Me too. I have something even more important: Actually, our house is small... the Manettis have invited us to the Opera. And my husband is almost a marketing manager... I can't come. You're wrong, they want you to come, too. We're a decent family, we shouldn't... With the Manettis? Never. There's no need for justification. Ciro, it means a lot to me, I've known lots of people who've abandoned their brothers! I want to see Tosca with my whole family. Isn't going out for a pizza better?

I heard that right? You haven't paid for three months, want to end up in the dungeon? "Friendship" means nothing to you? No. Flash news: a turning point in the Ciciarelli clan trial, where Ciro Cimmaruta is the defendant. Stay tuned. Each day that I wait is a finger less for you, clear? Very clear. Thank you, Mr. Peter. Mr. Mayor, good evening. - Four tickets for Coso. -Coso? Is that right? There are no invitations for Coso. - There's a mistake, check again. - I say there are none. Don't force me to call someone, check again. Don't insist, they're not here. Oh, God, a corpse in the kitchen! Ma'am, move aside. No, because I'm sure there's been a mistake. Look, follow the footprints, go see. - It's a matter of minutes. - No, it's a matter of respect! It's our right to enter, -Me? - Michele! if you don't know who we are, that's your problem not ours. Maybe, but you're not going in. Call the police! - Let's go have knddel. - Knédel? Darling, call the police! - Are you're boiling our neighbor? - What neighbor, what blood? - Spaetzle, something with speck. - Go have a pizza! I'm canning tomatoes! I said knédel, you can't make a decent pizza. - Take the bottles in the kitchen. - Michele, don't! - The redneck has spoken... - Calm down! Drop those bottles. - What did he say? - He's a hick! Michele, take them. - He said redneck, I heard right? - I heard him too. Michele, drop them. - Take them. - Drop them. You can call your sister ‘redneck'! Hurry inside, come see what's there. That's enough, darling! But you too... What else is there? Michele, the bottles. No crudités today, I cooked something. May lightnin' roast you, you idiot! Sorry for the mess, but it was worth it. She said lightning should burn you up, Here you are! without leaving the least part of your shit figure intact. In order of appearance: "homemade bread", macaroni omelet, sausage and broccoli rabe, mozzarella from Battipaglia and eggplant parmesan. And then, dulcis in fundum... the queen of desserts, a pastiera! I'm sorry, but this stuff will never enter my home. - We're an honest family! - What are you doing? What do you think happened? I'm throwing it all out! Nothing, No, not the pastiera! it was a misunderstanding, - The pastiera goes! - The pastiera stays. I hope they weren't offended. The pastiera goes! - Call them again. - No, I've called a thousand times. We're a pastiera-free family. I'll see him in the office tomorrow. I feel sick. Please, call them again! Be strong! She's like that when she cares for someone. It's still off. Jesus Arrested Vittorio? He's already here? - Is everything okay? - Sure, why? You're back much earlier than we thought. - Did anything happen? - No, a fantastic time, and you? With this the last trace is gone. Us... a great evening! You're still pissed off with me for that thing. Night. No, why should I be? They only arrested you in front of the whole town, you became a criminal, going in and out of prison, why should I have it in for you? - I've changed. - You've changed? My father died in the Camorra, Sure, you made a career advance, my brother died in the Camorra, you're in the Camorra! and I, one day, "died" in the Camorra. Congratulations. How shameful! When you left it wasn't easy for me either. Carmela, ma'am, yesterday's was the last hearing Think it was easy for me? and all the informers exonerated him. But I have to thank you, you made me so ashamed - 1 don't know this guy Ciro. - I think he's got no balls! that I found the strength to leave that place. Who the fuck is he? When you were a little girl, I was your hero. - Aren't you pleased? - Very much. Acquitted, not even a trial. He must be a petty crook, Right. When I was a little girl. like we say, a small fish. Honestly, your brother bragged about this thing. Mafia boss... The Perfect Camorra Man - Like me saying I'm an inspector. - Don't you dare! I don't know him! I've never seen him. Some people work tomorrow! - Say hello to Don Ciro. - Thanks for the coffee, good bye. You animal! When you prepare coffee, do you make a little pile? The hill? Yes. Vittorio! That's why it's no good. How do you get revenge on someone? When you make coffee, you have to press it or it's no good. What's there to get revenge for! Go to bed! I was terrible in school, too. - Indeed! - We'll go to the cafe, goodbye. If you're terrible in school, you'll do fine in life. It's not like that anymore. Vittorio! Come here, sit down. Coso, come with me. If you really want revenge, make him shit his pants, - My love, tell me! - My brother's been acquitted. the ideal is the severed head of a horse. - Acquitted, really? - Yes. Problem: you have to find a horse, cut off its head Great news, we'll toast tonight. -Did they say what happened? - The dungeon? and I assure you, it's not easy. The horse goes wild... Go run after the horse! Can you hear me? To be practical, the best thing is a dead cat. It's all cleared up with Manetti, I'll explain tonight, I have to go. Find a cat, you cream him, Where are you taking me? Do you know who I am? wrap him and take him to the location of the offense. Does Marketing Director, Mr. Coso Michele ring a bell? I'm Titina, the secretary on floor -3. Get it? Sure, you don't want to help me. This is your new office. Hold this. Whatever you need, don't call me. Hold this. Give me the car keys. What's a dead cat doing in the freezer? How do you usually preserve one? It's punishment for the bad advertising campaign? How do you usually preserve one? I don't know! Can I help you? I need some information. Which car is the English teacher's? I can't say, for his privacy. Thank you. Privacy! Look in here, so you'll see who you're dealing with. That asshole of a school principal Scared, huh? What is it? I took the wrong animal, shit! I'm incorruptible! Where's the car? Tell me why you boasted about being in the Camorra? I knew you couldn't be an animal like them. - What are you doing? - 1 made a mess, run! What gave you the idea? Why? What the hell... Because I wanted to belong to something. You should have said it's not your English teacher, but Alberico. - What a pain though! - The best defense is an attack. You belong to my family. React, or instead of slashing your bike tires, next time he'll dissolve your sister in acid. - Want me to shoot him? -No! Thanks for the offer, but I'll work it out myself. Yeah, right! Did you tell your mother? Ciro, Carmela, Your father? get up, you'll get all dirty! Okay, you told me. - What's so funny? - I'm thinking about Dad's face! It's nothing funny. You bastard! Listen, Mr. Principal, you're not kicking us out, Vittorio, if I were God... this would all be the sea. we're leaving. There's a big difference. I've calmed down, but he's punishing you for a month-old fight. You've even started smoking? Let's tell Alberico to speak to the principal, he'll back you up. Let me be, I've got loads of worries. He didn't let me into the party. What's the matter? Your train broke? What? - They slashed my tires. -l didn't doit! - The tickets for Tosca? - They weren't there. The loan sharks did! They've demoted me, moved me to the dungeon, taken the car... Why did you go to loan sharks? How could I have put people in pea pods? Because your sister spends a fortune. - I like it. - What? Your ad! It's cool, - She does it for the family. - I know. it gives the idea of warmth, home, protection. Know what this house costs and how much I earn? Thank you. -1,500 euro. - That's not bad. You won. 1,500, three times one is 3, three times 5 is 15... I'll ring and say it all, I'll say... "Darling..." Better "honey"! That's over 45 thousand euro a month, that's good! "Honey, the time's come to tell you You can't make that with protection money. that I've been fired, nearly fired. 1,500 euro a month! Holy Jesus! But it's right because I'm a piece of shit If I don't pay the mortgage, they'll take the house. who does shit ads, so be disgusted with me, walk all over me..." I'm afraid, what can I do? Don't overdo it! Talk to your wife, tell her the truth -Less? - Yeah. and spend less. When you love someone, it's not easy to be truthful. Come here. Listen to Ciro, Courage! eye on the loan sharks, those guys... Thanks, talking to you really helped me! Darling! I'll have a drop of grappa and try to sleep. Darling! Manetti sends his love, another pay raise - Thanks. - Anytime. and many compliments for the advertising campaign. - The one with the peas? -Atoast? To my family, including Uncle Ciro, who's been acquitted. The cat! They know where I live! They found me! What's wrong, you're not toasting? - Bye. - Bye, Vittorio! To me, who's been fired... or nearly! A matter of hours. To me who's been suspended! Good thing nothing's happened to me. Coming! Are you wearing make-up? What did he do? He beat up Alberico Manetti. - What's going on? - Uncle's been acquitted. I hope there's no problem at work. Alberico Manetti? Oh, my God! Are you crazy? What? What's your uncle got to do with Dad's job? I told him too, that's no way to... It's useless to invest in your kids! What's the connection? Alberico Manetti, I can't believe it! Can you tell me? What have you got to do with us? Why don't you say anything? My son's an idiot. He beat up his future. You knew it all the time and didn't say a word? - Does it hurt? - Mom, will I get suspended? You were right, it's hard to be truthful with those you love. For your own safety, I hope not. My son's an idiot! Mommy, telephone. Shove the offer-of-the-year up your ass! It was Mrs. Manetti. Oh, Lord! Hello, my dear! Stay focused, it's the chance of a lifetime. Great happenings! - Where are you going like that? - Nowhere. I want to be elegant when I spit in their faces. You won't spit in anyone's face, a little birdie tells me you won't be at dinner. -No? - No. Uncle! Mom, he died again. No, I just knocked him out with a sleeping pill. As a child, you know... - Are you nuts? - It's no tragedy. Get the rug, we'll wrap Ciro in it. something's hurting you and you grit your teeth so you don't suffer, Your uncle's better in there. Wake up! because the moment you give in... you're scared you can't bear it. Cold cuts and traditional cheeses from Trentino-South Tyrol Then you grow up... and meat puffs Cristina-style, that's me. - Meat puffs! - Yippee... and try not to feel the pain you felt as a child. I can't stand criminality, not even in baby form. The moment comes when... Scrumptious tarts? My son was attacked by a wild beast. you don't feel anything anymore "Wild beast" is a bit excessive. and you get messed up, all messed up... No, it's the right definition. Olive? I'd rather not say it was a Mafia execution, but... You want the family you never had. Of course! Yes, the perfect family. What else do you call a cowardly attack from behind? What an idiot! It's just kids' stuff, let's enjoy the cold cuts. Poor kids, ruined by a half-crazy mother. - We frigging won't! - We fucking won't, I say! And their father? Ambitious, a dreamer... A loser! Let's get to the point, our son's a thug. But it was nice thinking we deserved it. An idiot and a loser, what parents! But we're perfect just like this. - I made it myself. - It's compact, just how I like it. Thanks for everything, Cristina! My name's Carmela! Vittorio, if I were God... forget it! Time to eat! He was a rat, we shut him up! A bear who blabs is a dead bear.
