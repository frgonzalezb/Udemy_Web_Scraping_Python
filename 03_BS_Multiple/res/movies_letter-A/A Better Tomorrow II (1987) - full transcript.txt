A BETTER TOMORROW II (1987) - FULL TRANSCRIPT

foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- I've waited for a chance for three years. I have to show them that, though I may not be the best, I will take back whatever I've lost. Kit, calm down! Don't call me Kit, call me Inspector! Yes, Inspector. I'm not a boss anymore. For a brother... Kit. You were not wrong. We just chose different paths. You went the right way. Let me introduce you. This is Chief Inspector Wu. -And Inspector Chow. -Ho. Take a seat. We have a case, which, hopefully, you will agree to take up. Interpol has information that the headquarters of an international counterfeit operation has moved here. It's a fact. I want to solve this case before I retire. The few big operators, we've already finished them off. Only this suspect is left. The one who taught you everything, Lung. Fifteen years ago, Lung ruled over all counterfeit operations in Southeast Asia. We have not concluded -whether or not he is still in control. -Impossible! He has been retired for over ten years. Are you that sure? He's not that kind of person. He can change the way he looks, but he can never get rid of his criminal record. Ho, you were in the business. I want you to work undercover and investigate Lung. I won't do it. That's a fact. Don't you want to do something for society? I'm giving back now. I think I've done my part for society. Mr. Lung! -Daddy, I'm scared. -Don't be afraid. -Mr. Lung! -How do you do? How are you? Good evening. Hi, how are you? Ko. Lung. My daughter is very nervous. There's no need to be. I taught you right. Your mother and I danced like this 20 years ago. Everyone was applauding, from the first step to the last. Sometimes, you have to wait a long time for the first clap. If you did your best, someone will appreciate it. This way, please. No, thank you. Excuse me, do you know Mr. Lung? Yes, what's the matter? Well, I worship him. You worship him? I also enjoy watching people dance like this. I saw him dance 20 years ago. At that time, not many people could dance like this. So he was quite the sensation. I would really like to meet him. I'll introduce you. Someone wants to meet you, Dad. A secret admirer. I heard that and it hurt me a little. I'm sorry. I'm Billie. I couldn't recognize you. It's all right. But are you certain I'm your idol from 20 years ago? Actually, you haven't changed that much in 20 years. Stay calm. Dad, my heel has broken off. Why are you so clumsy? What should I do? Joe, think of something. Take your shoes off. -What are you doing? -Come on. The judges will feel sorry for you without your shoes on. Go on. Take a seat. CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT I can't tell anyone about the case I'm on. Not even you. Don't worry, I'll be all right. Take care. Wong. Lung, Mr. Wong would like to say hello. Lung! Wong. Good! Your daughter dances well. No one will wear shoes next year. Ms. Lung. LUNG SHIPYARD My dad talks too much. Don't talk to him. Sir! Billie is here to see you, Dad. -Really? -Sir. Billie. -Why don't you two chat a little? -Okay. This is for you, to wish you "smooth sailing." The business wasn't going so well. With this, it should be better now. I'll put it away for you. Do you like the ship? Sure. This nice young man, too. Billie says he wants to tour the shipyard. Yes, to learn a little about shipyards. I'm glad you're friends with Peggy. As long as she's happy, I'll be grateful to you. We cannot repay the bank. The shipyard could be repossessed anytime. How much cash do we have to pay off the staff? Not even a third of what's needed. What are you listening to? You want to listen? They say someone has applied for a winding up order. The only way out is to give up your shares and get some cash to tide us over. Hey! Are you listening to me? Yes. Mr. Lung. What is it? I've come to deliver the money to you. Lung, I've used all my shares to act as collateral against Mr. Wong's bonds. I've done my best for the company. If you let me have your shares too, I'll withdraw the winding up order. Who are you to decide that? In our time, we had a code of behavior. You respect me, and the respect returned is double. Ko might have had a lapse of judgment, he did this without consulting me. You are not worthy of my respect nor my disdain. Please leave. Seems there's nothing more to say. Nobody would dare not to give me face. Ho! I haven't seen Kit for a long time. He seems to be a changed person. He says he's on a special mission. When he's done, we'll change our names and identities, and move somewhere else. -Did he say what kind of mission he's on? -No, but he's become very strange. He was talking late last night with a girl named Peggy. I'm afraid he'll leave me. Why did you send Kit as an undercover agent? Don't you know he'll be in danger? Kit has his own mindset. No one can stop him. Okay, I'll work with you. Take Kit off this case. Let me think about it. Sung Tse Ho, remember, I didn't force you, you volunteered. We all have to be responsible for what happens next. When am I getting out? I'll arrange it. Sir. How did you get out? I escaped. I have nowhere to go. I want to stay with you. Give yourself up. If a man did something wrong, he should face the consequences with his head held high. I've left this business many years ago already. I want to go straight. But someone is always after us. I want to be clean, but no one believes me. You should have another choice. -Wong! -Mr. Chow. Thanks for coming. Emigrating so soon? Let's not talk about it. -Chung. -Hello. Mr. Chow. -Just help yourself. -Congratulations... Chan. When you aren't doing well, everybody looks at you like an exhibit. So you should look at them the same way. That's true. I'm over it. Dad says that, out of all my boyfriends, -you're the most considerate. -Really? He loves the boat you gave him. He asked me to thank you. Excuse me for a minute. Kit! Excuse me. Wong! Ho. My name is Billie. Billie. What are you doing here? I'm doing exactly what you're doing. What have you found out? Come. What about you? Wong and two gangs want to get Lung's shipyard. I don't know why yet. Get out of this. Let me handle it. You can't fight them. I've already started this mission. I must finish it. I've done this before. I know what will happen. I used to be too irrational. Maybe, after this, I'll understand you better. You're still so stubborn. You all know my problem. There's a note for you, sir. LUNG, I'M WAITING FOR YOU AT THE VIP ROOM. FROM: WONG When I drop my cigarette, shoot. Lung! Lung... I'm right here, what do you want? Don't get so mad. I just want your company to pay up. What game are you playing? You fooled me with cheap tricks. -You have no ethics. -Shut up! You have no right to speak. You... Mr. Wong, I'll be responsible for Ko's case. The law will settle this. The law? The law is up to me. It's simple, either sign these documents or take this bullet, up to you. I don't believe you have the guts to shoot. You don't believe me? Neither of us is that clean. Why don't we bet on it? -I'll be responsible. Leave Lung out. -Ko! -Ko, don't! -Settle the matter with me. -Step back. -No! -Move over, let me kill him. -Stop! What is it? Somebody is in danger. -Go and check it out! Yes. -Really? -You... -Put your gun down. Step aside, Lung! You think I have no ethics. Ko, listen to me. -We can't solve things this way. -No! Lung, let go! Don't! Let me kill him. Be careful! Put the gun down. Ko, don't! Lung! Put it down! Kit, take Peggy away. Look after her. Run! Lung, let's go! Do you know what you just did? You killed someone. I just want to know if you're innocent. He's just putting the blame on someone. It's no good. No one believes him. Everybody is after him. He has to leave town. Please, do something. This is against my principles. But principles can be changed. I do have a way. I can put him on a boat tonight. Thank you! I'm putting you on a boat tonight, Lung. What about my daughter? I'll look after Peggy. You can rest assured. Do you have any friends overseas? Yes. In New York. Fine, as long as you have a friend. Why don't you take me home? Your home is not safe. My girlfriend, Peggy. My wife, Jackie. Don't go! You lied to me. Calm down. Go inside. -Let go of me. -Go inside. Let go! Don't be like that. Sit down. I lied, but I didn't do it to hurt you. I'm with the police. We suspected your father was trading illegally. That's why I had to get close to you. You used me! Trust me. It's safer here. You had better explain. What were you up to? Tell me! Thank you. Go, don't worry. We should let Peggy meet up with Lung in the USA. And you? I'll try to join them. They won't trust you. I'll try anyway. Watch out for Ko, he's real trouble. You take care too. I will. I DON'T WANT TO RUIN YOUR MARRIAGE I'M GOING HOME DON'T LOOK FOR ME You really don't know where your father is? I don't. Have any of his friends said where he is? No. Peggy! Ho, Peggy is dead. Many things are memorable. I've turned all the events of your lives into many heroic stories. There's nothing worth writing about. That's not true. Nowadays, the world lacks camaraderie. The friendship you shared was precious. People like Mark, how many people are there like him? Who is he? He looks just like Mark. He's Ken, Mark's twin brother. He's a real tough one. He used to be called "King of Diamond Hill." People trembled when they heard his name. But he straightened himself out and traveled all over. At 15, he landed in the US, and traveled from the West Coast to the East Coast. He continued being clean. Everybody respected him. He's gutsy, all right. I'm Sung Tse Ho, calling from Hong Kong. Can I speak to Ken? Sure, wait a minute. Ken will scold you for dressing like that. So what? Let's sit there. Ken! Table number 10. There's a call from Sung Tse Ho from Hong Kong. Are you taking it? Tell him I'm busy. He has to hold the call. Those two said the dish was too salty and they want it changed. I'll change it. Take this out first. Keung. I've got a lawyer working on your papers. You can apply for your family soon. Thank you, Ken! Don't mention it. Go easy on the salt in the fried rice. Those customers are really making a fuss. I will. I was just worried about being caught, so I lost focus. I won't anymore. RED EAGLE GANG How does this look? What is it? -Ken! -Ken! You got a cold? Have you gone blind? You deserve it. I told you Ken would scold you. We just wanted to imitate Mark who was so manly. -We aren't blind. -You two. We just want to stick with a boss in town. You won't take us. Look at you. All of you are like circus clowns. Take those off and have some soup. Good. Great. What soup will they serve today? Hey, where are you going? Where are you going? Keung, bring two more plates of fried rice. Again? Go on! Damn those foreigners. Ken, Bobby has a gun. Here. My rice is good. -It tastes good. -Ken... Fuck off! What are you doing? Stop it! Eat up, you bastard. -Eat, you asshole. -Eat up! Drop it. Eat it up, damn you! If you don't, I'll blow your head off. Eat up, come on! When we parted 15 years ago, you said to look for you if I got in trouble. I didn't think you would come looking for me. Lung. Sam. It seemed so easy to kill someone before. Yet it seems so difficult to save someone now. But I believe in one thing. If you are determined to be a good man, you'll make it. You brat. Come, wash your hands. A tattoo of over ten years cannot be washed away. Some regular parishioners dare not come in because of it. Hello? Hello, Ko! Lung. Oh, good. Where are you now? I'm in New York. How are things? Things will clear up soon. I am collecting evidence. How about my daughter? She misses you. I'll arrange for her to see you. Do that as quickly as possible. Give me your address. Don't worry, I'll handle everything. Take care of yourself. He's in New York. God bless him. He's a sitting duck. Let's continue. How much more counterfeit do you need? I need 60 million Hong Kong dollars to supply Europe and South America. How do you intend to ship the money out? We have our own ships. Great. That reassures me. It's the same price, 38 Hong Kong dollars for 100 notes. Sam, I'll be able to see my daughter soon. That's wonderful. I told you not to worry. -This is for you. It's good. -Okay. Sam! Save me! Lung! Lung! Lung! Lung. Lung, we're home. Dinner time. I bet you haven't had such a sumptuous meal since you came to the States. Here, a sausage. It's not poisonous. A chicken leg! Nail you down. You're dead. -Diamond 2. -What? -Got any more 2's? -Get him! A Mr. Sung is here to see you. CEO'S ROOM I want to see Mr. Ko. Ho? When did you get out? It's nice of you to visit us. You really give me face. He's the one who shot Shing. The whole business knows about it. -You speak too highly of me. -This is Mr. Ko. Mr. Ko. What can I do for you? I used to work for Mr. Lung. He took good care of me. Now, I've escaped. I want to work with him again, but he's skipped town. It's my bad luck. I just want to make some money. So why come looking for me? I want to join your organization. You're mistaken. All our businesses are legitimate. We both know each other's background really well. Did you think I would just turn up without checking it out? Why do you speak like that? If there's money to be made, let's all make it. If you're interested, talk to Mr. Ko. If there's a chance for me to join, I'll agree with whatever you want. Then it's settled. Give us some time to consider it. We should all check out our credibility. Hope to speak soon, Mr. Ko. Okay. Mrs. Sung. You should discuss the baby's name with your husband. Please come in, Mrs. Cheung. Hey! How are you? Hey. How careless. That's pretty impressive. Where are you from? Do I have to be from somewhere? Not even a word of thanks? You want to talk business? "Talk business"? Sure. It won't do you any good if you don't eat. You're not a baby, so I won't make you eat. Feed yourself. Eat something. Come on! It doesn't matter if we're husband and wife, brothers, sisters, or whatever. It's bad enough that I can't help you. If you think there isn't a single person left to help you, why don't you help yourself? If you want to be ill, I'll be ill with you. If you want to give up, I'll give up too. If you want to starve, I'll starve with you. This is shit! Damn it. Damn it! Damn it! It's sweet. Eat it. Eat it... Good! Good, right? -Is that so? -Listen. You better not make up stories. We need to get Ken. Marco, notify everybody. -Get everybody here. -Hurry up! -We'll get them. -They're all going to die! They will die. There's nothing for you guys here. Ken! -Your problem is our problem. -That's right! I'm sorry this happened to you guys. You should all leave. Kill them all. Kill them! Ken. Ken! Why, Ken? Let's go, Lung. Ken! -Ken... -Don't follow me. Go home. Let us help you. You've made up your mind? Yes. If there's money to be made, then we're opening our doors. I really want to work with you. Do you trust me now? Everyone is different, so it's natural to be cautious. We must understand one another better, test our sincerity. How do we do that? I want you to get rid of someone for me. He has been causing me problems. He says he's one of us, but I know he's an undercover agent. I want you to kill him. Excuse me. It's Billie. You just let me know if you want to make money. I've always admired you. Mr. Ko, your status is somewhat different now. Talk is cheap. Let's make a deal. Sure. Chong. Billie, I know you're an agent. You want to get me? An agent? If I were one, I would have killed you already. I don't need to take this shit. If you don't believe me, kill me. Let his wish come true. You want to play? Go ahead and shoot me. Otherwise, I'll go to the police. Chong! Let me do it. Fire another shot or else he won't believe it. Do it! Sung Tse Ho, finish him! Between the two of us, it's enough that he trusts one. Shoot. Shoot! Actually, we haven't investigated this kid. We just wanted to test you. Welcome to the company. Thank you. Kit. Kit. Kit. Kit. This is your brother. -Miss, where is the emergency ward? -Over there. Doctor. Prepare for the operation. Get him inside, quick. Get him inside. Please hurry up, will you? You can't go in, wait outside. Ho! How is Kit? He's wounded. The doctors are working on him. He's okay. Luckily, the bullet went through. Don't worry. What's her name? Her name. Your daughter is dead. She's dead. Wake up, will you? Do you want to waste your life like this? Don't torture yourself. Everybody will be so hurt to see you like this. The Lung of the past could face anything. But now, you can't even walk out the door. Why can't you face reality? Why? You might as well be dead. Everything I've done over the years was washed away, too. I have no regrets. I don't need any sympathy. I'm not like you, waiting to die and looking for pity. I am still in control. If you do not admit defeat, stand up and fight with me. There's no such thing in this world as being forced. Get out! There's only one way out and you're coming with me. If we don't fight, we'll both die here. If we win, we'll start all over again. I know you can do it. Come on! No, don't. Don't make me! Don't force me! No... Peggy. I'm right here. Don't be afraid. Dad is right here. I want to see you. Peggy! Ken! Why... Why is it so difficult to be a good person? This is not our own place after all. Many try to leave home at all costs. Many want to go home. Some... Some cannot even find a temporary place to rest. Home is always better. Will you come back, Ken? Sure, to have some soup. You're so biased, keeping so many of Mark's things. Of course, he treated me the best. Look at this overcoat with over 40 bullet holes. It's a reminder for you to behave, so that you won't come crawling back in something like it. Lung! I've been waiting for you to come back. Ho! Look who's here. -Mark? -It's Ken! Ken! PEGGY LUNG PEGGY LUNG I'm sorry, I couldn't protect Peggy. I can only send her flowers every day. Thank you. It's God's will. Lung, Kit did his best. It's been hard for you. I don't care now. Why are you looking at me? You resemble someone. Someone dead? Your brother? Don't speak of the dead in a cemetery. I'm Sung Tse Ho's brother, Tse Kit. How are you? So you're Tse Kit! Just call me Kit. I'm Ken! Hi, Mr. Ken. Come on, we're both on the same side. Call me Ken. What happened? Got hit? In the line of duty. Just admit you got hit. Don't blame the job. You're a bore, just like your brother. You're like Mark, too. You have a sharp tongue. Kit. Jackie needs you right now. Go home. Why don't we let Kit join us? Maybe he has more information for us. An extra hand can sure help. Whatever you say. I can't figure it out. What does Ko want with the shipyard? I suspect he is using it as a counterfeit hub. He's going to make Lung the scapegoat. He doesn't need to kill Lung. He'll just make him go crazy. I'll burn up the shipyard. It's my life's work. No one can destroy it. But if it has to be done, I'll do it myself. What we need to do is to get evidence against them and clear your name. So, go big or go home. Got any leads? A buyer from New York is in town. He has a deal with Ko. Find out where their den is and take them down. Ken! Thanks, Lung! It's very sweet. Hey! For you. I don't like oranges. What is it? A shooting star. It's probably a firefly. In the police force, it's unlucky to see a shooting star. What's the point of knowing you'll die? The first time I saw it was at a cemetery. The second time I saw it, we were together. Such misfortune. So what? Are you worried? I'm not just worried. I'm very worried. I'm worried that I might die before it's over. Do you have a lot of unfinished business? It's better to go with the flow. As softly as I left you. As softly as I came. Not taking with me, any trace of the clouds. Who are those people? They look like the printers. Go back to the shipyard and get them started. I'll take the delivery tomorrow. Okay. -Ho, you go too. -Okay. -It's time. -Let's go! The boss is here. -Boss! -Boss! Hurry it up. Get a move on. How much do you think we'll make? Enough to buy a few nightclubs, I think. Hey, you! You've got the nerve to steal. Go to hell! Don't! What? Get to work. -Go. -Watch them closely. They're slacking off. Clearly, the counterfeit headquarters is at the shipyard. Ko has been running it. Then notify the police and clear Lung's name. Right. It can't be that simple. I feel like something is wrong. I saw it myself. Don't you believe me? No... Hello? Ko, this is Lung. I'm back. Lung. Are you okay? Yes. Thanks for your concern. Kit, I would like to talk to you. Leave this case. -But-- -I don't want you to get hurt. -Jackie is in the hospital. -Really? She's in room 704. You know she needs your support at this time. Ko Ying Pui. Go! What have you found? There's no one here. We've been had. Damn. Mr. Ko, we've notified the police. You think I really trusted Sung Tse Ho? I set a few guys up and got rid of them. Nice and clean. -You guys need to go. -Come on. Use the back door. The police are here. We want Lung alive. Hurry, get in! -You go first. -Let's go together. Go on. Look after Lung! There's gunfire. What happened? Follow me! Hurry... Found anything? Get in. You've really been hit. Are you scared? I'm not just scared. I'm very scared. Step on it, then. Ko's basement is really the headquarters. I finally finished this case. Yet crime goes on. So what if you cracked this one? Someone is bound to carry on. Right, and you're the one to do it. Kit. Stop the car, I have to make a call. We're almost at the hospital. There's no time. Room 704, please. Ho, this is Ken. He's fine. He's right beside me. Put Jackie on the line. Hello, Jackie? Hold on. Hello. Dear. -Is it a boy or a girl? -A girl. It's a girl. -What's her weight? -Six pounds and three ounces. She's beautiful. She weighs six pounds and three ounces. She's not very small. Mark and I weighed less than six pounds together. Who does she take after more? Like me. But she has your eyes. She says our daughter is beautiful. -She's got my eyes. -I can tell from your face. Bring her over. I want to talk to her. Don't be silly. She can't talk yet. She can only cry. Let me hear her cries, then. -Hello? -Kit. Hello? Why aren't you talking? Oh, I'm just too happy. Then come quickly, so you can meet her. I'm on the way. Hello? Kit, you haven't thought of a name yet. Kit. You need to name your daughter. Sung... Ho Yin. Be careful, mister. Kit! Kit... Go home, Ken. I can help. I can find you a getaway boat. It's not necessary. Ho, Kit fell from here. To our partnership. He must have taken the wrong medicine today. These grenades are powerful. I have to watch out this time. This place is finished. Those outside will take care of it. What? Are you trying to run? This is for you. You kill one, you get 100,000. -What, 100,000? -Let's go! Hey. What kind of bombs are those? They're so powerful! Want even more powerful ones? I'll bring them to you. I said no! Ko Ying Pui! Are you all right? Give me a gun! Ho! Lung! Ko Ying Pui! Lung, are you all right? Ko Ying Pui! Drop the gun. You're so serious about everything. You think a good man always gets a good ending? And you think a bad man always gets a good ending? Lung, are you all right? I don't need you to save me. Yes. We're being terrible. We're dying. Can we leave? So leave. Ken, you should go. Go on. Lower your guns. Inspector Wu, you better not retire. There's still a lot for you to do. We miss you, Ken. How are you doing? We're looking after the restaurant really well. There are more customers than before. You'll be very pleased when you come back. After you left...
