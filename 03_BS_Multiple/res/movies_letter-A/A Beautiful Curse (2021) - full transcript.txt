If you are still on the island, contact the authorities at 555-2368. If you are not able to quench your thirst, are feeling tired or lightheaded, do not stay by yourself. Call immediately. 555-2368. We can help. Let's find us some shelter. How about there? No. Ah, what about there? Yeah. Looks big. What do you think? Looks good, yeah? Hell-lo? Let's find you a home. Yeah... I'm going to call you Apple. Stella. Your name is Stella. Hey. Hi. Hi. Coffee. Yeah, it keeps you awake. Uh, I'm, uh... I'm... I'm Samuel. What do you want? Uh, I just wanted to introduce myself. I thought maybe we could talk about - what's been happening here. - What are you doing here? No one invited you, and you... You can't just walk in. Stella, wait! How do you know my name? There's still no logical explanation for what's happening to the folks on the island off the west coast. The government fears the phenomenon could spread to the rest of the country. Entering the area is strictly forbidden and could be extremely dangerous. In a few moments... It's time to get up. What are you doing here? No one invited you, and you... You can't just walk in. Uh, I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm, uh... I'm... I'm Samuel. What do you want? I thought maybe we could talk about what's been happening here. No one invited you, and you... You can't just walk in. Stella, wait! How do you know my name? Did anyone see you walk in here? I don't think so. You don't think so? Who are you? I'm a photographer. I've been, um, sent here to document what's been happening here. You're here for money? Sneaking around and taking pictures. If I could've asked permission, I would've. I was the last one to be hit. Who was the first? The piano teacher. She used to call the numbers at the village hall on Sundays 'cause Bingo is pretty popular around here. And, uh, right in the middle of reading out a card, she just... fell asleep. What did people do? That must've been, like, scary. Mm-hmm. They called the doctor. And there's no indication whatsoever that there's anything wrong with her. Well, apart from the fact that she's asleep and no one can wake her up, of course. Aye. That's when it really got complicated. Every time someone who's asleep is moved even a few meters from where they fell asleep... their pulse goes up dramatically. Like, really dramatically. The authorities told us that moving them could... It could cause their hearts to explode. But... that hasn't been reported. Tick... tick... tick... Boom! No one's come up with a... a logical explanation? No one has any idea how it started or how to end it. It's... No sign of disease on the sleeping people, no fever. People don't lose weight. They don't get bedsores. They just... they just... sleep peacefully. That must have been really s... scary for you, seeing people get hit one by one. I wasn't scared. It was just really odd. Just this, like, calm, weary feeling took over more and more and I kept having these crazy dreams, and... I felt just a bit dizzy, but not in a bad way. Like... Like, you know that feeling when you've smoked a joint and your body feels all relaxed? You smoke pot? Mm-hmm, don't you? No, no, I barely even drink. I mean, I might have a beer if I'm stressed, but no. Wow. Part-ay. Mainly I remember getting really, really thirsty, but no matter how much I drank, I couldn't quench it. And these really weird dreamy hallucinations. But mainly I remember getting more and more thirsty. Do you know... do you... What do you think it is? You wanna know what I think? Maybe everyone just watched the same boring TV show too many times. Maybe... This is a public announcement. If you are still on the island, contact the authorities at 555-2368. It is extremely dangerous for you to stay here. In a statement today, the prime minister promised more resources to the authorities trying to solve the mysterious phenomenon on the island off the west coast. The government fears the phenomenon could spread to the rest of the country, and authorities are patrolling the area from the ground and the air to make sure no one enters the island. I have to leave. And, uh, I'm sorry. It's too risky for me to stay. Are you afraid of getting infected? More of a hygiene thing. I'm actually almost never ill because I... I keep my hands clean. Well, you can get sick from being afraid of getting sick, did you know that? What exactly are you doing here? What am I doing here? Um, I'm here on a photography assignment. Yeah, I know, but why are you really here? Um... I c... I, um... I didn't just come here to take pictures. I, uh, uh, also came here... for... you. Yeah. Um, no, I, um... I came at, um... last summer. I was actually here with some friends. I, uh, saw you in the supermarket. Okay. Yeah, um, um, you were so, um... What was I? Um, photogenic? As pretty as a picture? Um, well, I don't know. You were so, like, um... Yeah, it's difficult to explain. You had a sort of energy about you, like, um, you know, cool. I don't know. Like, I just guess... I guess I wanted to, uh, get to know you somehow. I actually saw you later. Uh, I went out for some food with some friends. Uh, the restaurant was full of people, and, uh, you actually sat over there. Yeah, right there. And I... I sat here at this table. And you were having... You were having fun. You were laughing and joking and throwing things. And I was... I actually wanted to come over and talk to you. You know, it could've been fun. Why didn't you? I actually... I planned to. I thought I'd do it after you finished your mains, and then after your desserts, and then after you fin... You know, paid the bill, and by that time it was, uh... It was too late. So, what stopped you? Shit... Good morning. How are ya? Self-service today? Yeah? Okay. Let me see. Ah. But, you know, if you had risked it and come over, what would you have said? Um... well, I su... I suppose I would have, uh, introduced myself, and, uh, been like, "Hey, um, do you wanna grab some coffee sometime?" Oh, wow, coffee. Oh, God. That sounds epic. No, or, you know, have pizza in a restaurant, I dunno. What... Would you have said... ...yeah? Amazing Things: tape number one. People who bite their fingernails. The tapping sound of a typewriter. Wearing flip-flops when you shouldn't. Lasagna. A wine glass full of beer. Getting into bed with clean sheets after you've just shaved your legs. Barbie dolls, if their head is cut off. Balloons. Driving your car on the beach in wintertime. Unexpected phone calls. Owning musical instruments you don't even know how to play. Apples. Eating two bags of wine gums in a row after smoking a joint. Old wooden religious symbols. The periodic table of elements. Wearing underwear just out of the dryer. Growing your very own herbs. Old magazines. Hey, where do you wanna go? Um, I dunno. Wake up, come on! I thought I was the one sleeping here. - Do you have a car? - I don't have a car. - Oh. - Let's find one. - No. No, no, no. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hey, you can't steal a car. - Come on! - Stella. You can't steal a car! Oh, look what we have here. Samuel, what do you think? Nah, looks a bit dull, doesn't it? Hey, what about this one? Samuel? Come on over. We just need something with a bit more... power. - Power? - Style. - Style? - Bit classier? Right. Style. Ha-ha-ha! There we go. That is the one for us. What do you think? I think we should take this one, it looks good. Let's take it. Aw, it's locked. That's a shame. Oh, what a shame. Let's go and walk, come on. We need the keys, we need the keys! This way. Absolutely not. Absolutely not! - No, no. - Come on! - Stella. No, no. - Samuel. Don't be such a wimp, come on! Stella... Hello? Wow, this place is, uh... is pretty minimalist. Come on. Do you know him? Not really, but I... I've seen him in the supermarket. Are we allowed to be here? Coming from you? Seriously? Hey, dude, we're just going to borrow your car, but we're going to take really good care of it. Samuel, is he a jacket type, a dresser type or a kitchen counter type? What do you mean? Where does he put the keys? Ah, I'm going to go find them. Have you found them? Are those his? Yeah! You wouldn't have thought, huh? You can't just take his things. Who cares? You know, maybe he's actually a jacket type. Bingo! No... Do you know what, Samuel? What? Let's get killed. I don't have a license. Not bad, huh? No, it's nice. The sun is so nice. Do you know that feeling when you have cold toes and a warm face? I always have cold toes. - Now you wanna take a photo? - Yeah. Unbelievable. Have I told you you've got a really photogenic face? - Oh, photogenic? - Yeah. Is that good or bad or is that boring? Okay, you've taken enough. Oh, yeah, I've... Yeah, I've... I've... - I've stopped. - Good. It's nice out here. It's so calm. Mm-hmm. What? Quiet. Yeah, quiet. That's a cool scarf. You can wear it if you want. Yeah? Seventy. Thirty-six-point-six. Let's move on, shall we? Stuff that I dream of. To feel less vulnerable. To ride a flamingo. A furry friend. A constant smile to look at. Getting a letter from a stranger. Less loneliness. To be able to be invisible. To find someone to really trust. I, uh... I read this story... This sort of ancient story about how long, long, long, long ago, humans lived as one piece. Two souls formed as one, woven together. Together, the soul was incredibly powerful, and they were challenging the gods, and then Zeus comes down. And he, um... He cuts them in half, and he separates them. And so, they live separately, and that's why we talk about, um, trying to find your other half. Do you think there's one person for everyone? I'd like to think so. But how do you know if you've found the right one? I guess you just feel it. I dunno. Have you? Found the right one? Um... Have you? I thought I had once, but... Now I'm just happy being by myself. I just want you to wake up. I just want to meet you. I want you to wake up. This is a public announcement. If you are not able to quench your thirst, are feeling tired... ...or lightheaded, do not stay by yourself. Contact the authorities at 555-2368. It is extremely dangerous for you to stay here. Hey. Hey, buddy! Hey, hey, Apple! Look what I got for you in the supermarket. Yeah. Dinner, hey? Come on. Okay. Hey! Yeah, do you like your plant? Lasagna! Voila. After you, sir, thank you. Cheers! Mm-hmm. Beer in a wine glass. Yeah. Hey, hello. Hey, you. So, I went to the, uh, supermarket today, and I picked up all of your ingredients... You think you know me, but you don't. Okay. I feel like, um, I do. In some ways. Tape number two: Not So Amazing Things. I don't feel I'm good enough. I'm lonely, even with other people. The antique pictures I buy from the flea market because they help me feel like I have a real family. My parents told me my grandfather died before I was born. They don't know I know he's still alive. You can't get to know someone by going through their stuff and watching them sleep. What do you... I don't know what you want me to... What do you want me to do? I feel like I... want to know everything about you. But that's what I feel, and I don't know why, and that's what... um, that's what I've got to do. I want to know everything about you. I don't think that's such a good idea. I think you can, uh, learn a lot about somebody... by not just listening to what they tell you... but by hearing what's under the words. I find it hard to surrender. I don't feel beautiful. You don't even know me. I wish I never came here. Well, what's stopping you from leaving? Fuck off. Fuck off! What are you talking about? I would be way too much for you. Yeah, I think you would. Okay, well, I guess that's it. Yeah, I guess this will never work. Bye, then. I have a good feeling. Okay... Shit... - Samuel? - Hey. I've been thinking. I don't think I can change for you. I've been... I've been thinking, too. You shouldn't have to. I am who I am. I like who you are. But you've only imagined me. I think this can work. How? We don't even know each other. I'll show you. But what if you fall asleep? The longer you stay here, the more likely you are to be hit. I can't tell you what to do. You don't have to. I just want you to know... no one has ever made me feel the way you make me feel. You make me feel so happy. You make me feel so free. You do that. You, um... I'm just... I'm just scared... that... we will... never meet. It's time to decide how this goes. Oh, fuck. Mainly I remember being really, really thirsty. But no matter how much I drank, I couldn't quench it. I'm not leaving. Ow. Hello? Um... Hey. Hello? Hey? Hey! Come on. Hey! Wake up! This isn't real. Uh, did you put that on my picture? Okay. I'm just gonna let you... stay there. Hey, did you eat all of my apples? Hey! Oh, what? Okay, now I have a fish? Hey, did you make this? It's pretty good. Have you been looking in my diary? You... You listened to my tapes? The fuck is wrong with you! Why did you do that? Fucking hell. Now it's my turn to really get to know you. Have you ever been caught masturbating? - Uh, what? Um, no... - Clock's ticking! Okay, um, have I... Yes, I have. - By who? - Um... Uh, my mom. - Where? - Where? In my garage. If a family member needed a kidney and you were the only match, would you give one up? Would you give one up? Depends on who. - Your father? - Difficult. - Mother? - Absolutely. Have you ever killed an animal? Never. Do you ever rehearse a phone call before making it? Um, yeah. Um, well, it depends on who I'm talking to. Let's say me. Then I would definitely rehearse it. Do you have many friends? Do you feel alone? Not right now. Have you ever been in love? Yeah. Hi. Hi. I'm Samuel. I'm Stella.
