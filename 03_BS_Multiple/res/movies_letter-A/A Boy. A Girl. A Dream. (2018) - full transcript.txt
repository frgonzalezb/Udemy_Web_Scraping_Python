It could impede in what the polls are saying right now. Michigan and Wisconsin are so close. Um, just a really quick update right now, we have Hillary with New Mexico, Virginia, Colorado, Oregon-- These are all no surprises: Hawaii, California, Thank you for fighting for me. Thank you. You're welcome. The least I could do. We did not expect this race to be this close, that is for sure. Brother, you need some napkins? I have napkins up here. I'm fine. What happened? Ignorance. That's what happened. Let's just... We don't need to talk about it. I know all about that one. What you mean, you know about all that? What you know about all what? My dad is Arabic. I was raised Muslim, man. I deal with it every day. The Arabic part helps you out. Hmm! Does it? Trust me. Yeah, tell that to my fam, bro. Yeah, you can't know what's it like to wake up every... every day, over and over and over, they disrespect you just because of the color you were born in. I ain't disrespectin' you. I'm tellin' you. The Arabic side helps you out. Black man in America, you gotta wake up and act like the shit didn't happen. So you can't know about it. Man, my mom's black. Try being a black man in America every day, and then, uh.. being put on a terrorist list. Your, uh, dad being stopped for no reason, and, uh, your cousins not being able to come here. It's like being a black man in America. This shit ain't OK. Shit ain't OK, man. No, the fuckin' shit ain't OK. Hey. Shit is not OK. It's fucked up. But you know what, it's different. It's different for you, it's different for him, it's different for me. It's fucked up. God. Especially now. It's fucking crazy. Donald Trump has always had money. Do you think-- Listen, people who are voting for him-- This is for the voters: he has always had money. He has never even known anybody that is poor, that's middle-class, that's working class-- You OK? I'm fine. I mean, not really, but I'm fine. Just tired as shit. Same old shit. Every city, same old shit. Yeah. - Yeah. - And he only cares now because he wants your vote. And if he wins tonight, because of you, you're going to find out very soon that his interests are not yours. Welcome to L.A. Shit. Welcome to America. Yeah, that too. Trump began his unlikely bid to the White House in June 2015... What do you want? What? What do you want? Like, what do you really want? Uh... I mean, does it really matter, what I really want? It's not the movies, so... What? I mean, nobody ever gets what they really want. Says who? Who told you that? Society? Nah, man, it's just there's... things that I know, and that's one thing that I know. And I ask again, who told you that? Everybody. My mom, my sisters, my dad. I mean, literally everybody. Yeah, but you said you were grown. No. OK. I am grown. Let me put it this way. My mom... she had things that she wanted to do. Things that she was excited about. She had kids and then, we came along and she ain't get to do those things. So, how am I supposed to be just completely irresponsible and just go after something that's crazy, like... Just... - Crazy? - How can you do that? Yes, crazy. OK, so what... What did you go after? I'm a lawyer. That's nice. You hate it, huh? That why you rockin' the short crop with the blond hair at the top? - 'Cause you being rebellious? - Nah. Everybody needs a change. Even lawyers, huh? Even lawyers. What's that look? It's nothing. No, it's something. I mean, it's... It's like it's different. Like it changed. What's that look? I said it's fine. No, I'm saying it's different. Like, I'm, you know... I'm a film director, so I-- OK, could you just leave it alone, please? I said it's fine. My bad. I make good money. I own a condo and I'm able to take care of my mom, and she's the one who supported all of us. I'm good. I... OK, so... You got money in the bank. That's dope. What do you mean by that? Like I said, it's dope. You still didn't answer my question, though. Yes, I did. No, you didn't. I asked you what you really want. And I said nobody ever gets what they really want. That ain't my life. Oh. So, what? What, you went after the dream? You went after what you really wanted, so... - Yeah - I mean, what now? I'm going after mine. What you mean, "what now?" I'm going after mine. Are you? Yeah. What? Nothing. Hmm. What do you really want to be? I-- Go ahead. I'm listening. Uh... At one point... I wanted to be a DJ. You made me laugh. - I made you laugh? - No, I mean, in a good way. That's cool. - Word. A DJ. - Like... No, seriously though, like... At all of my, like, little get-togethers with my family and stuff, I like to pull out my Bluetooth speaker, and like... I don't know. - Like what? - Just... - Like what? - Make people feel something. You know? Move them. Make them think. Or just have fun for a little while. Music does that for me. Film does that for me. Touché. Well... I don't know, you got... a playlist? Spotify? What? Come on, you're old-school. You got a mix-tape, right? What? - Nah, man. - Yo, Naqeeb! - That's your name, right? - Yeah. Um... We got a DJ back here. - Word? - Yo. - Yo! - She got a mix-tape. I do not have a mix-tape! Let me-- Let me hear it! I know you got headphones in that purse, too. Come on. Once a DJ, always a DJ. Let it rip. - Hold that. - OK. All right. These things don't usually do well with my ears. - Well... - I got little ears, but... - Do you? - Yeah, I do got little ears, but hopefully your music is big. Oh, God... - OK. - All right. Let me know what you think. I'm in. - You're in? - I'm in. You go to the song you want me to... Uh... That one. There we go. For real? For real? Yo! Lawyer? Whatever. Damn! What's your DJ name? What? I ain't got a DJ name. Yo, this is hot! Your mama know you're this good? Exactly. Yo. Hmm. - Yeah, this is it, man. - OK. That's good. That's dope. Yeah? What's up? What? You didn't like it? Nah, it's incredible. No, I mean, it was incredible. Honestly. I just, you know... - My phone. - I real-- Yeah. - Right. - You got a whole life back home, and, look, this is borrowed time. OK... Look, I'm not with him anymore. It's-- It's none of my business. Oh, so you're not seeing someone? Yeah, I'm seeing everyone. Oh, come on, man, don't be like that. I saw you earlier. I saw you on your phone when I was walking up, and you sounded like you were all in love. Yeah. What? Now you don't remember? Oh, OK. But it's funny when you do it. Rumi. Rumi is my son. He's five years old. Oh. Look, I understand that-- No, I don't think you do understand. You fought for me the first day we met. And he's only ever... fought me. And he's only fighting for me now because I'm gone. Oh, my God, that view. Look at this. Ohh! So pretty. - It's so quiet up here, eh? - Yeah. Thank you. Hmm. Look up. Oh, my God. It's a full moon. Shit. Like a record. Yeah. Maybe it's a sign. Maybe it is a sign. Hmm. God likes music too. Oh, God loves music. Wait. Where are we? A friend's house. Find ourselves here a lot. After these kind of nights, you know? Mm-hmm. Let's go check it out. - Let's do it. - OK. Ah. Oh, thank you. This is it. Let's go in. Oh! Uh, anybody in here? - Hey, what's up, Cass? - You got it. What's good with it? - You all right? - All good, man. This is Free. How you doing? Nice to meet you too. Donald Trump absolutely needed it. He got it and now, as we talked about, he has many different ways to get to the 270 votes he needs to be the next President of the United States. Clinton County had a surge of Latino voters in the state of Florida. Looks like they actually did get an increase in Latino turnout, but it wasn't enough. In Wisconsin and, earlier in the night, Michigan was blue, and now they're undecided and they're leaning towards Trump and so, that's a big upset, stating that, you know, Michigan... Uh... I didn't expect for this to be so... Hey, guys. But, thing is, if he keeps winning this, mathematically, she can't beat this shit out! But she-- He can't win. I mean that-- I mean... Come on. But I mean, if they-- Who didn't vote? Like, who sat at home and skipped out on this election? 'Cause I voted. You're right. We all voted. If she loses Pennsylvania, it's a fucking wrap. Radio silence in Brooklyn right now at Clinton's party. A place that was jubilant and excited just hours ago, now you can hear a pin drop. That is not a good sign for the Clinton camp. I can only imagine the devastation going through Hillary Clinton's mind right now... We can leave if you want, you know. No, no, it's OK. - Sure? - Yeah. All right. I'm gonna go... make us a drink. - OK - All right. - Whiskey? Wine? - Wine. Something. Champagne. We just heard the list of states where Hillary Clinton would have to win all those states to have any chance... What's up? Good to see y'all, man. - What's up, man? - Got it. What's up, K? - Good to see you, my man. - You good? You know. - All right. - You know. I'm hanging in there. - Hello. - Hey. Thanks for inviting us. Of course! Wait, that ain't me. Russell invited y'all. You're not drinking? I had a little bit. Now, I'm having a little bit more. That's a lot more. Some big news here. Huge news. The AP now projecting that Donald Trump has won the state of Pennsylvania. This is a breaking announcement - from the Associated Press that cannot be underestimated. - It's over! This is 20 more electoral votes for Donald Trump. All the pundits-- This is breaking everyone's expectation-- Honestly, I never thought that that would happen... Hey. How've you been? Good to see you. I can't believe what's going on right now. Crazy, right? I'm gonna start throwing parties out here and be done. This is crazy! It's fucking crazy! What is happening is so crazy! We need to see this, though. Cass, what the fuck is your girl doing? - Wait, what's - Turn it back on! Wait, wait, wait. - Can you turn back on the TV? - Listen, listen, listen, like, I know we're all watching this right now, I know we're all caught up in this right now, but I think like, we just need to take a moment. We just need to feel good, like-- It's the election though! This is fucking crazy. I know! I know! But we need a minute, y'all! We need a minute to feel good. We want to watch history... But we don't need to watch this history. We need to think about our history. We need to think about life, we need to just... - feel good, y'all. - But I am thinking about-- Hey, yo! Hold on. - Give her a second. - This is consuming us. Ma, go do your thing. Do your thing. Play your-- Play your... Thank you. Yeah, I hate it. Hey Cass! Come get her, man! Hey, come on, man. Get out of here! Turn the TV back on. Grab her. Grab her. Dance with her. Just dance. Just da-- Hey! Hey! Just dance. Grab her. Whatever, I mean... The world is not dancing, man. - Might as well, you know? - I know. Hell. Yeah. Watch your drink. It is, but I mean, you know, it's not the end of the world, y'all. It is the end of the world! Cass! It's good. It's good what you did. Hey, hey, hey. Really! Don't worry about it. You did good. You see, they're hugging each other. Yeah. They're dancing. Look. He's dancing. You good? All right. Sorry! - Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. - Hey, hey, hey. Don't worry about it. Come on. Let's go outside. Come on, let's go. Wait! Wait! You turn the thing off and now you're leaving with the music? We're going upstairs for a bit. Hey! Hey! Hey! Love y'all. Turn the election back on! Hey, I'm sorry Cass! ...those 20 electoral votes get Trump to 264, six away-- I like her haircut! Man... That was crazy. Yeah, it was crazy. Watch your step. We need that, man. - Yeah. - We need that. Hey. - I want to show you something. - Wait. Huh? Ugh! - Let me show you something. - Sorry, what were you saying? No, take that. Just take it. - No, take it, take it. It's OK. - I'm sorry. It's all right. Hello? What? Yo, yo, yo, yo. Look, it's-- What are you talking about? Yeah, well, that was like... That was your whole thing. Like, that's your own problem, like... Yeah, but why are you stressing me out like this? It's so annoying, like... Seriously? Seriously? Now? Now? Now you're feeling bad? Like... Dude, what are you talking about? Like... Why are you stressing me out for nothing? Ugh! Are you serious? Like, really? Really? All right, well, I gotta go. I gotta go! Hey. So? Uh, man. I had a great time. I had a lot of fun tonight. Probably about that time, right? You gotta get going? - What? - You gotta-- Wait, wait, what were you about to show me? - Nah, it's nothing. - No, tell me. You got a flight to catch, right? Come on, man. What were you about to show me? It's nothing. Seriously? - Just show me, like... - No, it's nothing. What? Yo! All right, then we'll just give up 'cause I can see that you already have. What'd you say to me? What about that script that actress asked about? Your film that everybody's waiting to see? It's all over you, like... You came out here to do something. Are you just giving up? Says the lady who... You're not even trying to follow your dream. Give me a break. What do you mean? What do I mean? You're not trying to follow your dream. You're living all safe, you go back to your little comfy, boredom, basic... what, nine to five? You kidding me? Telling me I'm giving up? Fuck outta here. - Come on. - Oh. OK. So, now you know my life. - Yeah, I do. - You do? You know my life? - Really? - Yeah, yeah, 'cause I live here. The city of dreams, right? People be like, "Girl, let's go to LA! Let's go to New York! Let's go to Miami, but, whoa, let's not go too crazy, like, let's not get free." What you're trying to say? You're free? - Yeah. - Are you free? - Really? - Yeah. - Really? - Yeah, really. I'm getting mine, yeah. You think so? Mm-hmm, yeah, I see you getting yours. You know what's crazy to me? I think, um... I think you're safer than I am. I think the closest that you've come to feeling alive is trying to fuck a girl named Free in the club bathroom. So, yeah, I see you. I see you getting yours. I'm sorry. I saw that kid, earlier. I saw how he looked at you. He admired you. Hey. What do you really want? - What happened? - Nothing happened. Nothing happened, all right? Nothing. Nothing happened. Everything's always fucking happening. I get tired of fighting every day. I fight every day. That's my occupation. I fight every day. That's what happened. He really did a number on you, huh? Hey. Oh, my God! He did not just win! He did not just win! Trump is fucking president. Oh... Wow. Oh... Geez... I'll follow you. Shit. Hey, hey, y'all! Hey, hey, hey. Everybody knows what it's like to fight. We've all fuckin' have fought before. Everybody knows what it feels like to struggle. Uh, struggle to be loved, to love, to work, to be free. So, uh... we're still fighting, right? Tonight proves that it's not different. So now we know we just got more work to do. That means you too, huh? What? That means you too. What you're saying is you got more work to do, too, right? Yeah, Ray. Real work that we all know you can do. - I said, "Yeah." - Yeah. - All right. - That means me, too. Handle your business, Cass. Let's go. Oh, man... Ohh... Doesn't look as bright as it was before. Yeah. Oh, well... Naqeeb... you're still here. Yeah, I got, uh... stuck listening to all of this. I would've been a danger on the road, so... I didn't drive. Understood. What is it, man? How could you not be, man? You guys leaving? You want some company? Yeah. Could use some of that. So how about I order it and then you-- No, man. I got you. Nah, it's cool. I can-- Nah. Where you all goin'? Hop in. Goin' to Mel's. - I got you. - All right. Thank you. Of course. - You said "Mel's", right? - Yeah. Donald Trump, after the election's, president-elect of the United States. And then Clinton headquarters in New York City stand on baited breath waiting for the final word, that there may still be a chance, but all they get instead is a simple statement from Chairman John Podesta, saying, "We're not going to have anything to say tonight. Get some sleep. We're so proud of you--" Naqeeb, you can turn the heat down a little bit. Of course. "She's not done yet." I'm at a loss for words. I digress, I go to my listeners. Caller one? It's kinda funny saying "Turn the heat down in Los Angeles." He's waving to the public. There's no question-- It's kind of a cold night, though. Understand. ...misogyny, homophobia, the bigotry... This is what we've seen in real time and through history with this guy, when he was kicking black people out of their homes in New York, when he was piling up the sexual assault cases from these young women, a lot of them are probably still scared to say anything. But what's deeper than that, Tim, what's deeper than that, what I'm worried about is what's happening to our country. What's happening to the people, to the children, because of a guy like that... Say what you will about Obama, but he won by people coming together and believing in something bigger. I remember that day and I know you do, too. Trump? Trump will not heal. It was his appeal. And now, this country's more divided than I've ever seen in my life. My job... we represent bad people. There's too many bad people winning. ...just lying and hateful and violent-- Too many bad people winning. And I'm afraid. Can't say it better. Sums it up. God. Dig even deeper than that and what do we have? We have, what, the-the massacre of our-our Native... Native American Indians? Dig deeper. What about slavery? And the confiscation of our native peoples' land? He made America hate again. This country is called "the United States," for a reason. Think about that. The first name in our country is "United". And, I'm sorry, we're more divided than ever. And I don't know what's gonna change it. That's all I gotta say. Thank you. Oh, my goodness. Rob, I'm happy to know there are people like you out there in the world. That this is what makes America great. You OK? I will be. Trump promised to build a separate wall between the southern border and Mexico. Bringing back manufacturing jobs-- Feel bad for the children that have to... Say the first president was this guy. What are you thinking? Was thinking how I named my son after... my favorite poet. Or how excited I was to, um-- when he was old enough to understand it. Yeah, Rumi was one of our great writers. I was thinking how there would be nothing better right now than for my kid to write a poem, so... Oh, man... I always tell him that he's smart, he's strong and he's loving. If he's anything like, you, then he is. It's nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you, too. You know what, Free? It's safe to say I'm starting to remember why I moved out here. Why? So the good people can win for once. The good people can win for one. Amen. Naqeeb, you want anything? Nah, I'm good, man. Thank you. God bless you. As-Salaam-Alaikum. Wa-Alaikum-Salaam. Is this...? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wow... Wow. - What are you thinking? - I mean... I need to see this. - Like, I need to see that. - But it's not-- The full-length version of that! - It's a rough-- Gotta edit it-- - No. No! No, seriously. Like, you need to send that. Send the script. It's just-- It's not finished-- Send the script to the actress from the club. Just send it to her. Send it as is. Go for it. Like... Like... do you understand how important this is now? And how important art is? This is everything, this is our voice, this is who we are. This is all we have left. This is important, man, like... Just let me clean it up first. No, man. You need to send that. You need to send that. Like, you need to send that! Seriously. This is everything. - Yeah? - Whoa. Oh, with everything that's going on, the fucking shit we're dealing with, like... we got nothing else. We got our voice. We got what we put into the world. We got purpose, we got... We can inspire. It can really change things. - You really think so? - I really do. I really, really-- I really do. - You're not bullshitting me? - No. All right. You send that, get this thing going, and I'll, um... I'll cancel my flight. I'll stay. - No, for real, like, I'll-- - You wouldn't do that. --cancel my flight. I'll quit my fucking job and stay. You crazy. You're for real. Send it. My flight is right here. Send it. Send it. One... two... three.
