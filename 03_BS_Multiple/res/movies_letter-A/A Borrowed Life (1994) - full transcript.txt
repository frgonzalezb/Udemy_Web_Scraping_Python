foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Don't hang around here. You'll catch a cold. Just remember what I told you... When Father goes out, you go with him, OK? Stop playing. Mei Fong, stop it! Wen Jian... You're old enough to take your own bath. Are your balls still here? Let me find your balls. Here! They're here. Tonight? We're going to a movie. Really? Sure! With Akiko or that gang of yours? With everybody. Is that true? Why would I lie to you? Honest. Here, I'll help you bathe. This part's uncle's specialty. Cleaning your little prick. Hey! Grey hair. I told you not to buy cheap stuff! You never listen to me. If it's made in Japan it'll last at least 10 years. (Japanese) Hey, keep the kid at home! Wen Jian... Go! Go! Follow him! Stay home! Hey! (Japanese) What! (Japanese) No money! (Japanese) Damn you!! All Father's life... ...when someone asked him, "How old are you?" He would say... I was born in the 4th year of the Japanese Emperor Showa. So I figured out a formula: Showa minus 14 equals the first year of the Chinese Republic. Just as we all know... Year one of the Republic minus 11... ...equals the Western year 1900. According to this formula... ...Father was born in the 18th year of the Republic... ...which equals 1929. So he should have been 65 this year... ...if he was still with us. Why are you carrying that excess baggage? No way out of it. With a horrible wife and an impossible son. So we take him along. If I didn't say I was going to the movies... ...if I didn't let the kid come along... ...they would have caught me right there. (Japanese) What if your wife asks about the movie? â€“ Shhh, Careful what you say. (Japanese) The kid knows a little Japanese. Just now... ...his mother asked for money. I was surprised that he blurted out, "Okane Nai". (Japanese) Really? No kidding. Come, Wen Jian. Tell me, what does "Okane Nai O" mean? "I need money to go to the market." Let's go! He doesn't need to go to school. He knows enough already! Keep quiet when you get home. "Matsuko went to the beach alone." "She looked at the ocean. She couldn't help crying." "Her tears dropped down like a broken pearl necklace." "Tear by tear, drop by drop." "And at this very moment..." "Haruki came all the way to visit her..." "...to find out Matsuko was gone... Everybody panicked." "Haruki-San, she is gone." "What should we do?" "She missed you every day." "Let's go find her." "Where on earth could she go?" "She could have told us." "I am afraid something could happen to her." "Let's go find her together." "So the three of them went to the beach." "But not a soul could be found. "Let alone Matsuko." Would you be scared to watch the movie alone? Yes. Damn it! "Matsuko!" "Matsuko, where on earth are you?" ...Excuse me for a moment... ...attention Mr. Sega from Datsukeng... ...Mr. Sega from Datsukeng... ...phone call for you at the ticket booth. I am going to get the phone. Don't go away. You hear me? To continue..."The cold lonely beach..." "No matter how they cried..." "...how they called..." "Matsuko was nowhere to be found." "Matsuko!" "Matsuko!" An announcement from the snack vendor: Ice cold popsicles have arrived! Ice cold popsicles have arrived! Those who missed them the first time around... ...have a second chance now! To continue..."Finally, Haruki saw..." "...Matsuko, whom he missed so much." "Poor couple!" "The poor couple finally saw each other." "There were a thousand words to say." "But they just held each other in their arms." "So tight." "Matsuko!" "You are such a fool." "Don't you remember that we made a vow to each other?" "It's all fated." "Why did you do this to yourself?" "I... I didn't know what to do." "Besides you..." Your Uncle Tsan is in the hospital with a fever. I have to go see him. I'll be right back. You stay here and watch the movie, OK? It's a good story. Watch! "Besides this..." "...I didn't know what else to do." "I've already realized" "that my husband and I won't work out." "Our relationship's come to an end." "Matsuko..." "If you've decided to leave him..." "...in any case..." Uncle Tsan! "...l'll take care of you forever, Matsuko..." Uncle Tsan! Whose kid is this? Why is he shouting over there? We're trying to show a movie here. Somebody watch over the kid, please! Sorry! Let's continue... "But you should know?" "The baby, the baby I am carrying..." "...is due anytime..." Hey! Kiddo. Aren't you Sega's son? Hey! You never know, "Good fruit from a bad tree." Such a lovely boy out of a father like that. Come, I'll take you to find your dad, OK? Let's go. Watch your step. But my father is in the hospital. I know. Your dad is not the only one who has a fever. Let me tell you. All your father's friends... ...they all have a fever. Come. Watch your step. Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom. We are just warming up! Don't worry! I'll be right back. Little boy, would you like some more soda? Be good. Sega is quite a singer. Not bad. Sega, we need a girl over there. Do you mind? You guys stay here. Come right back! I'll be right back. Let me serve the other table. Let me make some more money. I'll be right back. Who is this kid? Sega's son. Oh! Sega's son. Little boy, do you know who I am? I bet you don't know. I am your illegitimate mother. Call me Mom. Hurry! No? It's OK. Then, give me a kiss instead. Enough! Stop teasing him. Clients are waiting. Hurry up! I'll give you 50 cents later. What am I gonna tell your wife if I don't clean you up? Just clean it up. What a saint! Such a clean body. Sega! Your son got the most, but paid nothing! He has lipstick all over his face! Who did this to you? No wonder I didn't get to have a good time. Hey! Lovebirds! Lovebirds! Poor lovebirds! Let's teach him a lesson. Hide yourselves. Hey, big brother... What are we gonna do with big brother? Just throw him down the hills. - Are you sure? Never mind. Just carry him! Akiko... I'm so touched by this gesture... Her mother goes into hysterics at the sound of Tsan's name! But she's so faithful to him. Let's tease him. Hey! What's going on? What a show! We thought you were the most innocent man! What bullshit! So your suit is decked with gilded leaves! The hair is shiny and parted to the side. Once he gets a girl next to him, he forgets about his buddies! When you're in love, go all the way! Forget about money, forget about reality! We thought you were so innocent! What bullshit! Where did you go? To the movies. Where else? To... Nowhere. Don't try to fool me. What's the plot of the movie? It is... A man holds a woman. Then? They kiss. And? They cry. And then? They kiss. Next? They cry. And? ...And the film was over! You should learn to clean yourself after you steal a bite to eat. Here! Lie down. Before I went to school... when the miners finished the day's work... ...I loved to wait for Father in front of the gold mine. Mom would say to me: "Greedy kid..." "...begging for a snack!" In fact... the mine was cold and wet, so deep and so dark. I would imagine that it was a monster. It seemed that it'd swallow up Father and his buddies. Had I not waited for them, the monster wouldn't spit them out and send them back to me alive. I didn't dare tell this. I was not able to explain anyway. It's ox knuckle. Chiretta. Do you know what you're talking about? Shut up! Wen Jian, for you. Is medicine more appetizing? Cassia buds, Cnidium officinale. Hey, these herbs are for women. Then that's right. This one's for women's afflictions. My daughter-in-law has a problem with her period. I can't tell which is which... Is this the one for me? Yes, just take it home and eat it. Thanks. Put a label on it! Ok, come visit me sometime. OK. Ma'am... Tell your daughter-in-law... ...not to touch anything spicy after taking the medicine, or it won't work. Sega, I bet your period is now regular! Don't eat anything spicy. Shut up! Get out of here! What's wrong, ma'am? She's a slut, that's what! I wonder what magic spell Tsan's cast on her. Calm down, calm down. Alas! What a life! What a jinxed life! Deceased husband of mine, why didn't you take me with you? Why didn't I die with you? Akiko, say sorry to your mother. You have to listen to your mother. Ma'am, please stop it. Akiko, come here! Go apologize to your mother. Go, hurry up! I've never seen such a stubborn girl. Nomu, come here. Akiko's mom used to take good care of you. Go take her home. Akiko. Go, go, go home. Let her go. Never mind. It's not the first time. It's routine. What's going on? It's none of your business. None of my business? What are you babbling about? What? Looking for trouble? Hey! What's going on over there? Don't know. Don't know? Don't look there. Look here. The lottery's a sure thing. Grand Prize, 200,000 dollars! Thanks a lot. Nowhere to spend it if I win it... Didn't you hear the news about the Battle of Quemoy? They won't draft an old man like you. Hey, I tell you, those who survived the Japanese occupation... ...will be sent to Quemoy sooner or later. How to spend it when you're dead? I'll spend it for you. I don't mind your spending my money if you're my son. Cut it out! Don't joke about such a great financial opportunity! Hey, I mean it, you'll win. That cripple who charms women... he won a hundred the first time he bought a ticket. Fuck you. He's got a name. Don't call him a cripple. But he is a cripple, isn't he? Fuck you. Sega! Keep cool! Money everywhere. It's money all over here. Look into your conscience, OK? Being a cripple is sad enough. You just threw two hundred thousand dollars on the floor. You think you're above him, eh? You guys stay here, I've got to go. Put the bill on my account, Chang. I'll pay you later. Lan. Coming. Open the door. Where's Akiko? She's behind me. You young people are always rude and careless. You never think about your elders' feelings. Tsan came to talk to Sega about your plans to elope. Sega told him: If you run away like that... ...what is your mother gonna do? Mrs. Sega... ...I know what you mean. That is why... ...Sega took you back with him. Thank God Sega showed up today. I was thinking, I'd wait until the last train. If Tsan didn't show up, I'd just lie down on the rail. Thank God Sega was there or I would be dead meat by now. People would be laughing at me. I'll take you home. Never mind, Mrs. Sega. There's nothing to worry about. We all have a mother. I'm no different. Akiko, take an umbrella with you. Tsan! I know you're still awake. Let me tell you: You're not only a cripple. You're not much of a man either! Here it comes! The palanquin is coming. Stand aside! Give way to the palanquin. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations to the groom. You're certain to win that 200 thousand dollars. I bet you'll win. This is your luckiest moment. Ok, not now. Can't you see we're busy? It's your chance to win. Just once in your lifetime. You'll win 200,000 dollars. Tomorrow. Come tomorrow. We're busy today. 200,000 dollars. You'll win it! You'll win whether you're busy or not! Congratulations. Here it comes! Easy, easy. The bride is pretty and neat. She'll take care of her parents-in-law and keep the family's good name. She joins our family at an auspicious time. Many good sons will follow her. The couple will love each other for a long, long time. They will accumulate so much wealth that they'll need a bank. As the bride steps out of the palanquin, may her sons all be handsome and intelligent. One will be president. Another, a senator. As the bride walks over here, may she bring good sons and wealth. As the bride enters the door, may the couple live and love for a thousand years! What are you doing here? Why didn't I see you? My father sent me here to see how you're doing. Your father... ...how considerate. Here! Come! Uncle'll show you something. Come. Who is this? Uncle Tiao Chuen. What about him? Uncle Ah Fu. And this? Father. And this? It's you! Why did you have to go into the army? Uncle was still healthy at the time. I used to hold you all the time. You have to remember me. Remember me always. Keep quiet Hurry up! Akiko... Hey, come over here. Have you lost your balls? Come here! I'll beat you up if you don't. Just this once in your lifetime. One last look. Come on, what the heck are you scared of? Take a look! Tsan, take a look. Look, look. Who's peeking on the roof? Blow them up... with firecrackers. - Never mind. They can't do anything! Fuck, so what if we take a look? She's your wife already. We can't change that fact. After that night... ...I became curious about the window over the roof. One day... ...I couldn't stop myself. I climbed up carefully... ...and peeked through the high window... ...just like the adults did. Through the window... ...I saw a room, in the darkness, Akiko was taking a nap. Soon she woke up, She looked at me, a little confused. Quite a while later... she finally recognized that it was me. She smiled at me. Why are you hiding here after work? I am listening to the short wave Japanese news. Can't you read our newspaper at home? If you would believe what the Taiwanese newspaper says... you would believe in dogs wearing underpants. Be serious when you write. Can't you even write your own name? Attention! Attention! Accident at Iron-Gate Mine! Get everybody over here! Attention! Where is Tiao Chuen? I saw him going over there already. He's gone over there? To the mines? Hey! You forgot your rubber boots. They're here! I'll get them. Get out of the way, kiddo. Be careful! Have you got the tools? Hurry up, you guys. Hurry up! Ma'am! What happened? Sega... Sega... Hurry up! What's going on? Sega, calm her down... Go in and bring him back! He's blown himself up with dynamite! Make her calm down! It's all right! It will be alright! Tsan will be all right. All right. I don't know what to do if you keep crying. Everything is gonna be all right. Stop worrying. Stop worrying. What am I going to do? Watch her! Hey! Sega. The dynamite smoke hasn't cleared! Get the tools! Sega! You came together? Akiko, Tsan's mother is mourning. Don't go in. My son... My poor, crippled son. What did you do this for? What am I going to do? Mrs. Tiao Chuen! Mrs. Tiao Chuen, please. Ma'am, don't do this to yourself. What? She passed out. Go get Uncle Fu! Don't be sad! Since he didn't care about you, just forget you ever had a son. He couldn't hear you crying. Stop pining away. What's wrong with you? Have you seen a ghost? You have Tsan's flesh on your clothes. Lan. What's wrong with you? Why are you so sick? Sega's got Tsan's flesh all over him. What's wrong? Go get a chair. Go, get a chair for Lan. Stop vomiting. Lan, what's wrong? Feeling better? Yes. You can take some digestive medicine. It's not diarrhea. Do you have dried plum? Stop crying, damn it! What's the problem? Everybody knows you're unhappy! What if I was dead today instead of Tsan? I bet you would be laughing so hard. Nomu, what are you doing? Save some strength for tomorrow. You've got a wife to care for. Not to fight with. Fuck you. Are there movies in the middle of the night? Do you think that I know nothing, so easy to trick! Tiao Chuen... Go take a look. (Japanese) It's OK, just leave him alone. I know what you're thinking. I've never been in your heart. Mrs. Tiao Chuen, please go take a look. I can't believe you guys are sitting here doing nothing. It's none of our business. And you cry! I'll beat you up if you don't stop crying. Nomu! What are you doing? Looking for trouble? Nothing's right today. So shut up and go to sleep. Sega, what're you doing? Are you crazy? Fuck! You animal! Fuck you! You're no better than a pig. You're not human. Stop it now! Stop what? I don't like what I hear! - Who are you? Akiko's lover? - Do you have no feelings? Did I hear correctly? Someone's lover? That's enough. Stop it. You fools! Sega! What's wrong with you? Your buddy's dead and you guys are fighting! Go home! It's all my fault! Stop fighting! Go. It's all my fault. Stop fighting. If Tsan could hear you... ...his ghost would come to get you. You think you're a better man. It's all my fault All my fault. Soon after Tsan's death... my father was laid off for the first time. The gold mine was no longer as prosperous. That year... ...I was just going into elementary school. I took many trips with Father to town. Just the two of us. Father would bring some stuff. He would go into a shop I've never been before. They would give him some money. There was a piece of cloth hanging at the door. With a big word on it. "Pawnshop." I misread if for the word for "wealth." I thought it was some rich man's house. Mei Fong, it's starting to rain. Don't go out. Good baby... Stop crying. Father's back. See? Father's back. What's going on? It's only a typhoon. What is all this food for? Have you prayed? It's OK. I'll hold him for you. Go cook, will you? Hush, baby! Stop crying now. Hush, hush. What the hell are you crying for? You've scared away all my luck. Stop, stop. Shut up. Shut up now. Hush, hush! Shou Mi... ...come clean this up. Cry, cry! You just keep crying! What are you doing? If you don't want to raise him, why did you have him in the first place? Good boy. Good boy, stop crying. Wen Jian! Open the door. What's wrong? Can't sleep? If you can't sleep... ...come help me protect the house. Are you scared? Of what? You're old enough. You must set a good example for your siblings. You're going to school. And you are the first son. There are some things you must know. Do you know why... your brothers and sisters are surnamed Lian. And you are the only one surnamed Jian. Therefore, when you know how to read and write, go buy a notebook. Keep a record, beginning with Father. I came from Min Xuong, and married into your mother's family. You are my first son. I promised your mother's family that you would take their name. So your name is Jian, but you are really the Lians' son. Understand? Write this down for all your descendants. When you grow up, when you meet a girlfriend, or your son or grandson meets a girlfriend, all of you must not marry girls named either Jian or Lian. Moreover, the Sus, and the Chous, used to belong to the same family. You can't marry any of them either. Understand? Do you know... ...why your younger brother... is named Jia Min? You know? Stupid. His last name is Lian and his hometown is Jia-Yi, Min-Xuong. I did that so he will never forget where he came from. Are you afraid? Liar. I tell you... when you grow up... ...if you leave such a big rock at home for more than 3 days... It wouldn't matter how old I am. I would beat the hell out of you with a broom. You hear me? Prompt Delivery Mail. Where is it from? It's from Jia-Yi. What are you doing? Is this a treasure... or are you doing your daily exercise? No, it's from the typhoon. Would you be so kind to help me move it out? - OK. Move away. I'll take care of it. Here, little girl, get up. I'll take care of it. Take my hat. Hey! Don't get in the way. You'll get hurt. To move it, you've got to know the trick. When Father came back that night, he didn't ask about the stone. But when he finished reading the letter, he said that his youngest brother is gonna join the army. Then... ...he sat there with Mom and worried. I didn't know if he was worrying for uncle's safety, or his upcoming travel expenses, or all the things that were going to happen. Finally... ...our neighbors came to help. They helped us with the money and all the support we needed. Do they fit? A little bit too big. Would you like a smaller pair? Never mind. I'll stuff some newspaper in them. Strange. It looked like that my son's feet were as big as his. Why are they so much smaller? Mrs. Tiao Chuen. Come here. You look great. Isn't it a little too loose at the waist? No. Sega. There, try them on. Brother's back. Brother's back. Hurry up! Sega's back, with his whole family. Come out. Father, please sit down. Sega, he was once a naughty boy. If only he were as good as your two kids. But Sega, he was bad. As a stepmother, it was wrong for me to be too harsh, or too nice. When he graduated from elementary school... ...he couldn't stay put at home. His dad asked him to help on the farm. He was very unhappy. One day, he was asked to dig bamboo shoots. He said there was a hole in his clothes and I didn't even care. He was really mad. He cursed me in Japanese. When his father heard him, He got beaten up. He ran out... ...picked up some cow manure... ...and threw it over my face. The manure was all over me. Then he ran away and never came back again. Where did he go? He went to... a medicine shop in Jia Yi, to be an apprentice. His dad went to see him secretly once. He was much better. His dad was so happy that Sega had a secure future. Unfortunately, before he finished his apprenticeship, there came the February 28 Incident. Right in front of Jia Yi station, a lot of people were shot dead. Amongst them there was a doctor, whose name was... right, right... his name was Pan. Hey, do you know how silly Sega was? During the daytime, he bought some incense sticks and ghost money. He was giving offerings to Pan at the balcony Those owners of the shops... ...were scared to death. They told him to go away. Then his boss... ...got scared as well. He asked him to leave. He was fired. You never know, he finally settled down on the northern tip of Taiwan. I guess he was better off like that. Mining for gold is much better than staying at home, working on the farm, or working at the medicine shop... ...as an apprentice. You see, everybody in your family... ...is dressed up clean and neat. I pray to God to bless Chin Juen, so he will stay healthy in the army and that he will come home soon. Marry a woman and have lots of sons. God bless him. Mother, please! What if he is sent to Quemoy? Brother, we have few chances to get together. Now that I am going into the army, I wonder if we will see each other again. Of course we will. Money comes easier in the gold mines. Can you give me that old watch as a reminder of you? Here, put it on. Is it too tight? - Yes. It's adjustable. Have someone adjust it. You must come back safely. Father and Mother... ...will be counting on you to look after yourself. You must write us often. You will be far from home, so write us as often as you can. Days go fast, you'll be back in no time. The training will be good for you. It's time. It's time to go. All my life I have been raising sons for other's use. A few years later, the gold mines were closed one by one. Neighbors and friends moved out of the village one by one. Many times, Father went in town to look for jobs. But soon he would be back silently. It was Mom who started getting small jobs. She worked harder than Father. Go away. Will you stay away? Hot oil will get on you. What are you hanging around here for? Go stick around him. I told you to go away. Bring the food to the table. Find Father, tell him it's dinner time. I did, he didn't answer me. Fine, then none of us will get to eat. What, you have a problem? If you're not happy, get out, too. Like damn father, like son. Don't you have any homework to do? Are you blind? Playing that tile? Shut up, go do your homework. Go home and sleep. Don't discard that one. That's the one Uncle Fu's waiting for. Sega, shouldn't you call it a night? Let's count it. I've never seen a gambler with an adviser. Go home. You aren't going to school today? Everyone's ignoring me. Today's Sunday. Let's eat. Strange. Why does this bowl... Iook like mahjong tiles? There're mahjong tiles in the bowl. The food vendor didn't come today? Of course he did. Then how come there's nothing to eat today? I was expecting that you'd earn some money from your game. We're all expecting... ...for you to bring food back. The kids could use some new clothes. They are also expecting... ...for you to bring money back so they can have some new clothes. Wen Jian... ...needs a pair of rainboots badly. He goes barefoot to school on rainy days. Stop the shit. We are all waiting. The whole village is moving out. People are ribbing me: "When is Sega going to win some big money, "And move in with us?" You tell me, How am I supposed to answer these questions? I've lost all my face! Your father's birthday is coming up. I bet what you have in mind is a big present. Because you've been gambling so hard lately. And so seriously. Damn it. What the fuck are you babbling about? What are you looking for? Brother's hurt. You don't ever take good care of the children. Get the medicine! Get the medicine! Get the medicine from the drawer. Not this one, this is shoeshine oil! Get the one with the golden dog label on it. Why don't you bang your head outside. Don't scare the hell out of the kids. All right, only if you take good care of them. Where are you going? Stop running! Take that! Stop running! Stop running! Stop running! Stop running! Don't think that you can control me! Stop running! You can't control me. Stop running! What's there to be afraid of? I'm only afraid of being poor. That night, Mom ran away from home. She went to Yue Mei Mountain in Sjiaoting to become a nun. A week later A monk brought her back. I wrote this down in my home diary. My teacher told me to write a letter to the police and asked the police to get the gamblers. I wrote a letter as he told me, leaving my real name and address. When the police were not watching, I threw the letter at the desk in the police station. That was the first time in my life that I did such a thing. But, I am afraid it was also the last time. Wen Jian! Take your brother home. Why did you bring him with you? He is such a cry baby. So are you. So shut up. Don't forget to bring your abacus to the class tomorrow. Oh! Here comes the saint. Here! Jia Min. Mei Fong, get a bowl of rice for your brother. Wen Jian, come here. This is some kid! He writes good letters. So you write well. Very well! A few years in school has made you a slavish dog. You wrote to tell on me. Enough! Stop it. Enough. That's enough! Say sorry to your dad. I didn't do anything wrong. Fuck you! If that's the case, I can't help you! Sega, are you crazy? Is this a show or what? Enough! Don't be crazy. You're crazy. You're really gonna hurt him with that. You guys shut up! You are not much of men. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Shame on you! Don't be afraid. I won't let him hurt you. Let me see. What about your eyes? What are you doing, Sega? Your eyes are so red. The police officer's illiterate and you go down to his level. Let me check. You're hurt by the bamboo tips. Ma'am, it's no big deal, don't worry. It's OK for you to say so. It's only someone else's son dying. Go mind your own business. Go home! Open your eyes. Let me see. You'll feel better when I blow some air into your eyes. Sega, see what you've done. They're so red. What are you going to do if he becomes blind? Let me see. He won't die! Come over here. Wen Jian. Let me wipe your face. You're sweating so much. Brother, would you help me with this? Brother... Sega, you're back. Buying some today? Not today. You're back. Yes. You're so used to being a foreman. It's such a hard job. It's all right. I'm used to it. Go get a kilo of noodles on credit. Do we have black sugar at home? Get half a kilo as well if we don't. Oh! What are you eating? Black sugar. Can I have some? Look what you did. Go away. Go home! All of you! Wife and sons are impossible! What's wrong? What is it? Look what Father did to my flag. How am I going to turn it in? I was just trying to be helpful. You should thank me. The sun should be red, shouldn't it? I've never seen a white sun. It was designed to be a white sun. The designer didn't have any sense at all, and neither do you. Have you seen the color of the Japanese flag? Is it white? Nonsense. (Mandarin) Who do you think you are, Japanese? You're just like the traitor Wong Jin Wei. You think that I don't understand Mandarin? (Mandarin) You're a traitor. You're just like Wong Jin Wei. What did you say? What did you just say? Nothing. Father, your foot is bleeding. I know. You must study hard. Don't be like me, leading such a hard life. Next time put a little less salt in the soup. Five years later, I moved to the big city, studying and working at the same time. All the gold mines were closed by then. Father changed jobs. He now worked in a coal mine. Our small village was left with few people. As a result, he got a chance to be Neighborhood Head. He said that the only incentive to take that job, was that they offered a free newspaper that he could use to wrap his lunch box. Father. Working so late? Yes When did you arrive in Taipei? A while ago. It's so hard to find your place. What's this black stuff? It's coal ashes. What's happened at home? What could happen at home? This is my salary. Would you take it back for me? Send it by mail to your mother. Why give it to me? You've got enough money on you? Yes. Go take a bath. How could you read something like this? I'm learning English. Damn it! Strange! How come her hair up there is blond, and down there, it's black? Breasts, too big. I guess the Japanese size is better, Japanese girls are more delicate. Go take your bath. Wait a minute, let me use the toilet first. Where is it? I'll show you. Which one? The last door on the left. The last door? Yes. When he was in the bathroom, I wrote a letter home. I asked what happened. Later, my sister wrote back and told me, that Father had a fight with Mother... ...over playing mahjong. She asked, "He really visited you?" "We thought he was gambling all night that night." Hey, Hong! Were you caught in the rain just now? Shit! I was soaking wet. I wonder who's in the bathroom. He's been shitting for such a long time. I can't even take a bath. There's no need to hurry. Let's have some tea, OK? OK, just a minute. I'll wait. Hurry! Aren't you? I'm Wen Jian. You're Uncle Nomu and Aunt Akiko. You've grown up! Do you still remember... When you were 6, once you climbed up to the roof, and peeped on me taking a nap. Eh, you're Fatty, right? Yes. You used to be very fat. When I saw Akiko and Nomu, I found out suddenly, that I'd forgotten about Uncle Tsan for such a long time. That afternoon, Mom made some sweet potatoes. They talked about Tsan's mother. She once worked in an umbrella factory. The factory gave her some defective umbrellas. She gave them to the neighbors. For quite some time, all the women in our village, were all using those deformed umbrellas. Later, the umbrella factory moved somewhere else. She now cooks for the workers in a condom factory. Akiko's mom has a rather stable life in Taipei. She goes square-dancing every day. And got to know an old mainlander. According to Akiko, they two are having a good time together. But when they fight once in a while, her mother would be crawling all over the floor like she used to, trying to get sympathy. Other than this, no one mentioned those old events. Mom! Mom! - - What? Come take a look! Check if it's straight or not. Left! Right! Too much! Back a little. Hurry up! Plug it in. Hey! Look! It's flashing. - You are celebrating Christmas too? - Akiko. Aunt's back. Tsan's mother comes specially to see Akiko. Yes. I'm back. We haven't seen each other for such a long time. You never come to see this old lady for all these years. So sorry. The kids are still going to school. - Aunt! - Nomu! You're back too. You haven't changed since I last saw you. You must be kidding. You don't look old at all. It's not possible not being old. And who are these little children? My children. They're yours? They are bigger than I thought. - One is in 2nd grade, the other is in 5th. If they were my own grandchildren, I would be so happy. This is for you. I've got nothing else to give you. It's from the factory. It's free. It's free, just take it. Just take it and use it. I didn't have time to get red envelopes. What are you doing? No, no... It's only a greeting present. May you grow up quickly. Thank grandma. Grandma, thank you. Good, good boy. Go call her grandma. Grandma. Good, good, very good. Hey, what are you doing here? Hurry up! Hurry up! Where's Wen Jian? Wen Jian, are you hatching eggs? Hurry, get your ID and seal. We haven't seen each other for a long time, I can't believe you're just asking me to vote Come on, there's only an hour left. Where is Tiao Chuen? - He's not back yet? Not yet. Let me go take a look. Don't forget your ID and seal. How about coming to my place? Just like the others, Tiao Chuen came back for the election. He looked a lot older. His wife said he had a difficult life in the city. He had some problem with his lungs. He had to take medicine every day. She asked Mom to take care of Father. She warned my sister never to marry a miner. If she did, she would be worrying all her life My sister reassured her in earnest. Tiao Chuen remained silent for a long while. A while later. He asked me suddenly, "Who's the president of Uruguay?" Wen Jian, Are you still going to school? Yes, I go to night school. Who's the president of Uruguay now? I don't even know who's the president of the United States, let alone Uruguay. You must study hard. Knowledge is power. No matter how difficult it will be, you must give the children an education. I already did. They are all going to school. Hey, you're still sitting over here! Come in here. The vote is unanimous. It's unanimous. Hurry up. There's no doubt about it. He's gonna win for sure. Lin Tsai Wang, one vote. Lin Tsai Wang, one vote. Lin Tsai Wang, one vote. Great. He's got it. Quiet! Quiet! Let's see. One to Lin Tsai Wang. One to Lin Tsai Wang. Again, one to Lin Tsai Wang. Again, one more to Lin Tsai Wang. It's sure now. Here's the last one. What are you waiting for? Hurry up! One for Lin Tsai Wang. All the votes! All to him! He swept it! Congratulations, congratulations. Though we've got no money, we've got guts. So many people, but one mind! Hey, why are there only 386 votes? There should be 387 votes. How come there's one missing? Are you sure all the votes were counted? It doesn't matter. He's already won. No, we have to get to the bottom of this. Sega, don't make a fuss out of it. We've got to check and see why there's one missing. One vote's missing. You must investigate. What's going on? We're missing one vote. We've got to see who's that black sheep. Everybody came out to vote. I can't believe someone abstained! Sega, listen... just think that if we tell everybody who he is, he will be so embarrassed. I don't care. He didn't care about the pride of our village Why should we care about him? Right? - Forget it. - Shut up, it's none of your business. If everybody thinks the way you do, soon the village will die, and you will all be responsible for it. OK, shut up, there's one who didn't pick up his voting ticket. Which one? Which one? Someone name Lien Ching Ko. Lien Ching Ko? Damn it, Sega, it's you! I didn't vote? It's all right. Never mind, we don't need your vote anyway. I was so preoccupied I completely forgot about casting my vote. OK, we're not interested in your explanation. Sorry, you asked for it. You've been like this all your life. You never cared so much about your own family Well, you deserved it. So don't speak before you really know anything. Now, you're stepping on your own face. You keep overreaching yourself. See what happens? Put a sweater on. Unlike in Taipei, it's cooler here. You might catch a cold. If I were you today, I'd be ashamed that I'd hit a new low. What? No leftovers? What of it? Where have you been? Why are you back so late? I've been listening to jokes about my old man Here's my salary. Give it to your Mom. Don't give it to me. You've got money on you? Yes. It's the Japanese team. Who are they playing against? With us. Then we don't have to watch the game. It won't be interesting. They won't play if they're no good. The Chinese team is dead for sure. It's hard to say. Don't talk before you're sure. Go! Go! Get the ball! Get the ball! Swish! Get the ball! Get the ball! Pass it! Hurry! Pass it! Nice! Pass it! Get it! Get it! Look here! A country that's held the Olympics won't lose to us. I'll have them commit hara-kiri if they lose. Eat your food. Stop shouting. Look! It's in! Hara-kiri! Hara-kiri! That's enough. What is it to you? Mom. What about me? It's for the house. Go do your homework. I have something to say to your brother. What is it? The postman found us a house in Rei Fong. Do you want to look at it? Do we have enough money? We should be able to scrape it together. This place... Sooner or later our village will be empty. We must move out. What does Father say? No need to ask him. He doesn't have any money anyway. But at least you should let him know about it. No need. He'll find out. Go! Go! Go Chinese, go! Go! Go Chinese! Chinese, go! Go! Go! Go! Get the Japanese! Kill the Japanese! Hurry! Hurry! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Two more! We've got two! Two more points! Two more, hurry up! Hurry up! Go! Go! Hara-kiri! Hara-kiri! Go! Go! Another two! Hara-kiri! Hara-kiri! Do it! Two more points! What the heck are you shouting about! It's midnight! What's wrong with that? That's enough! - No one watches TV the way you do. What are you fighting about? (Mandarin) You're always like this. You're a traitor! I should have drowned you when you were a kid. Where're you going? Go watch Japanese get killed. Horrible wife and impossible kids. Strange! Shame on you! Don't you think you're old enough not to fight with kids over a TV program? Horrible wife and impossible kids. Impossible, just impossible. Come here, leave him alone. Nuts. Alas my youthful days... Alas my tragic destiny... All the tears in the world can't bring back... ...the vanished days of youth. Alas my youthful days... Alas my tragic destiny... That winter, we moved out of the old village. Three years later, the whole village was empty. The name "Datsukeng", disappeared from the administrative map of Taiwan. When Father was 53, he wasn't any luckier than his friends. He got a common disease among miners: "Silicon lungs." He retired at 55. After 35 years in the mines, all he got was some 200,000 dollars of pension. He gave it all to my younger brother as capital for his small business. At the age of 58, he became a frequent visitor to the hospital. Aside from this, he had to depend on oxygen on a daily basis. At 59, diabetes added to his problems. (Mandarin) Why didn't you do it? (Mandarin) It's all right, sir. (Mandarin) No one else will see you. (Mandarin) It's OK. (Mandarin) Are you listening to me? (Mandarin Why can't you do it while others can? (Mandarin) You are strange. (Mandarin) I won't clean for you if you piss in bed. (Mandarin) Sir. (Mandarin) It's OK. (Mandarin) It's OK to use this. (Mandarin) What's the difference between this and the bathroom? Have you ever seen a man sit to piss? Damn it! What's going on? Where is Mom? She's back home taking a bath and getting changed. Take this off for me. Help me to the bathroom. The doctor said that you don't take the medicine on time. Every time that you're out of the hospital, a week's medicine... ...would last a whole month. The medicine's free. What on earth are you saving for? What the hell do you know? If I take that medicine, I'd become impotent. I'd be like a dead snake. You know? Have one more. Your Uncle Tiao Chuen is dead, you know it? I know. They stuck this big pipe... ...into his mouth... ...and forced this stuff into him. His eyes almost popped out. I would rather die... ...than being treated like that. Father, That's called a Respiratory Machine. It was for his own good... ...to have to use it. We had made an oral agreement... ...when you children had all grown up... ...and married... ...we would have no more burdens in our heart. We were going to take a trip to Japan together... ...to see what the Imperial Palace and Mount Fuji looked like. Shit. He left before me. Which of the two colors do you prefer? Of what? Lipstick. I don't care. How much is it? - It's too red. - Don't ask about the price of a gift. Mei Fong always buys the cheap stuff. You always say that. But it's true, so don't complain. Don't use those dull colors when you go out or go to a wedding. You must dress up for it. I'm too old to dress up. This is a lotion. How do you use it? Apply it on your face, after washing. Why didn't you put on the oxygen? You're panting so hard. I wouldn't let my grandson mistake me for a monster. Hey! You keep on eating, without asking if your Grandpa wants some. Hey! (Mandarin) Your Grandpa is talking to you. (Mandarin) About what? What? (Mandarin) Grandpa is asking you. (Mandarin) That cake you've been eating, (Mandarin) you're not going to share it with him? (Mandarin) He can't eat anything sweet, can he? You have to listen to your grandson. What can I do then? Two Taiwanese gave birth to a mainlander. I could never understand him. I'll ask him to study Japanese if you wish. Father! I can't even touch it? What are you doing there? You're old enough... ...not to make that kind of noise while you're looking for things. Hey! What? (Japanese) I've got no more money. Do you suppose I have any? Am I making any money? How could I have any money if it weren't for the kids? I gave you 2 thousand dollars just two days ago. And it's gone? Father, I've got money. Never mind. (Mandarin) Oh! Grandpa is eating egg cakes. Father, what do you think you are doing? It's all right. Control yourself. Your blood sugar is so high. Control yourself. You don't like taking medicine. Mom worries. It's OK. As he wishes. Look! Look! He's got two hidden here. Here are two. Father, please. Control yourself. Control yourself. I'm responsible for my own life! I don't care about it anymore! I've figured that out a long time ago. Let me die! (Mandarin) Grandpa, take some oxygen. (Mandarin) Please don't eat egg cakes by yourself again. Father? When did you arrive? You should have called us before you came. No one's home picking up the phone anyway. How long have you been here? I'm tired. - He is tired. I have to go park. I'll be right back. Father, let's go. Japanese toys are better. If it is made in Taiwan, it wouldn't survive such torturing. You should have called before you came. And you didn't bring your oxygen. Should you take your medicine in such a haphazard way? The hell with it. It's just as well. I want to go to Japan and take your Mom with me. Fine! But wait till you get better. I'll go with you. Don't join a tour. You'll get herded around like chickens. Never mind. I already joined a tour. They even gave me a travel bag. How are you supposed to go like this? It's OK. Haven't you seen me taking medicine regularly? And I can go without oxygen. Father, that's good to hear. But we can go later when you're more recovered. We can then go together. I would like to go to Japan, too. You can speak Japanese. You can take us with you. Don't be silly. I won't get better. If I don't go now, I'll never go. Never. Look. It's in color. I look younger in the photo. It took me to this old age... ...to get a passport of the Republic of China. Drink some water. Grandpa is leaving. Give him a kiss and say goodbye. Good bye, grandpa. Good bye. Father, take care of yourself. Be good and study hard. Bye! Drive carefully. That night, before I headed for Taipei, he asked me to get some U.S. Dollars or Yen. He said he was going to buy some things for everybody. He said, there were many great products in Japan. Father didn't seem to understand his own health condition. But he was also right. 4 days before his trip he was again hospitalized. It was June of 1990. In October, he was taken to the Intensive Care Unit. How is he? They gave me this. What is this? A liability waiver. Why don't they let us in? It's not time yet. Mom. Don't worry so much. This is not the first time we've signed such a waiver. He survived those. You don't understand, this time, it's serious. The family can come in. One at a time. Wen Jian first. Put on the antiseptic gown. Father. Fight it. Like you did last time. You'll get over it. I've already got my visa. As soon as you are out of the hospital, we'll go to Japan together. Grandpa. Only one at a time! Don't let him see me... ...the way I am now. You tell him... ...that Grandpa is just refilling his battery. OK, I know. Don't say anything now. You just keep thinking, I'll fight, I'll fight. If only I could... ...sleep for half an hour, I'll have enough strength to fight it. OK. I'll talk to the doctor. (Mandarin) Doctor, (Mandarin) Can you give Mr. Lien (Mandarin) some different medication? (Mandarin) Lien Ching Ko? (Mandarin) Medicine... something... (Mandarin) that can let him sleep. (Mandarin) A good sleep. (Mandarin) Let me check. (Mandarin) Is it serious? (Mandarin) It is indeed serious at this stage. (Mandarin) We've done all we could. (Mandarin) If he doesn't get any better, (Mandarin) we'll put on the pipes. The respirator. (Mandarin) That's all we can do. The doctor said, it's because of the weather that you have been panting. If you fight it today, you'll feel better tomorrow. Mandarin... I can understand a word or two, you know. That's right. So you've got to have faith. Fight it. Help me over here. See if I'll feel more comfortable. Go ask your mother to come in. Get her in. How is he? Is he better? When I saw him like that, I wish I could breathe for him. He said he wanted to look outside. He asked me to pull the curtain. I told him that it was dark and raining outside. And there's nothing to look at. He said, Maybe he'd feel better if he could take a look outside. He wanted to talk to you. Don't talk too much or he'll be too tired. How is it? Do you feel any better? What? Go get a chair... Put it over here. I'll lay my feet on it. Don't go back to Taipei tonight. Take good care of your mother. I know. Don't talk anymore. Rest a while. Sorry, time is up. Open the window for me... No, It's windy outside. It's cold. Give me some more air. More! I am going. Father. I am going. Remember, Fight it. When we saw his body in the mud and grass, and a group of doctors trying to save his life, knowing that it was useless, I felt panic, and hopeless. I didn't know what kind of lie to tell Mom who was expecting some good news at home. Suddenly, I remembered the time... I was left alone in the movie theatre. For a moment, I felt I was left alone by Father again. Again, he had left me in this space, filled with low sobbing. He himself, on the other hand, went to a place, secret and strange to me, where I'd never been where he and his buddies were having fun. If you weren't travelling to Japan on business... I wouldn't bother with this. What's the big deal about Mount Fuji and the Japanese Imperial Palace? Why was he so obsessed with them? Isn't the Emperor dead? Yes, now his son's replaced him. Which one? Is it Michiko's husband? You're right. For them, the father and son got the same job. While your Father used to say that his best wish for life was that his descendants didn't have to work in the mines and didn't have to follow his route. He was half in the coffin before he got old. On January 12, 1991, Father finally laid eyes on the Japanese Imperial Palace and Mount Fuji. That day, the first snow of the year fell in Tokyo. Father was silent, like the falling snow.
