foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- DJ: Well, folks, make no mistake, it's hot out there. Hot as hell and dry as a nun's gusset. And we're goin' on our ninth year, nary a drop of rain from the heavens. But as we look forward to the fall and a visit from the Queen of the South herself, let's whet our ears with a spritely version of her Steady as the Rain. We're here to humbly serve, you're listnin' to Radio HQ. ♪ Radio HQ ♪ (UPBEAT ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) BOY VOICEOVER: One day... I found something important. (BIRD SQUAWKS) My Abuela one day said, "You find the most important things "when you're not looking." (BALL THUDS) That day, I was not looking. So, when I found it... I knew it was important. That is my friend, Peeti. He is always looking. But mostly because he cannot blink. (MOODY ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) Papa came here to start living in a quiet place. But when I was born, it got hot and it hasn't stopped, and people in the town got tired. (WOOD CREAKS) I like it because it's quiet. (PEACEFUL ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) When I was a baby, our house bent down. So Papa put a stick to always keep it back up. (BALL THUDS) (PEACEFUL ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) (STICK CREAKS) Sometimes, Papa is thinking about horses. But mostly, he is thinking about the stick. Mama is mostly thinking about other people thinking. And meatballs. Sailboat. What is this little guitar you have on the table? It's a little guitar I found behind (SPEAKS SPANISH). To English. An angry cow. (PAPA SPEAKS SPANISH) They can be very angry. Such a beautiful little guitar. Such craftsmanship. (HOUSE CREAKS) Such delicate inlays. Can you play on this little guitar? No, but I was thinking to teach it to myself. We will love whatever comes from you brushing on this little guitar. We are blessed with you. (WOOD CREAKS) SAILBOAT: Papa's good at listening. Did you check the stick when you returned from leaving the manger? No. We must never forget. I will do it first thing. (PEACEFUL ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) SAILBOAT: My Abuela one day said, "Some things happen, "so other things can happen." (GUITAR PLUCKS) (LIGHT BULB BUZZES) (PEACEFUL ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) (PAPA GRUNTS) (HOUSE CREAKS) My school was also-- (BELL RINGS) Mostly a quiet place. (UPBEAT ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) But not everybody liked the quiet. (MUFFLED ROCK MUSIC) (SNAKE HISSES) Like Mr. Bing. BING: Right! SAILBOAT: He didn't go to quiet much. The ultimate challenge, little people. Bing. Versus beast. The serpent. (SNAKE HISSES) Jurassic. You must control the enemy. You might yourselves, why doesn't he let it out of the bag? Why don't I let this out of the bag, why? So it can escape me and bite someone on the neck? (CHUCKLES) Oh, no, you've got to control the enemy. That's right, supremacy of the fittest. Yeah. So, which one of you little tigers think you've got the stones to come up here and touch this bag? Huh? Didn't think so. (CHILDREN LAUGH) (WHISTLE BLOWS) (UPBEAT ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) PEETI: The Rattlesnakes. The Rattlesnakes. The Rattlesnakes. The Rattlesnakes. You should try soccer with the team. The Rattlesnakes! (WHISTLE BLOWS) SAILBOAT: Things at my school like to stay mostly the same. (MUFFLED ROCK MUSIC) But my Abuela one day said... (UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC) "Things can change." (BELL RINGS) (EXHAUST BACKFIRES) How'd your day go? I fixed the strings on my little guitar. I got a call today, Abuela is very sick. (EXHAUST BACKFIRES) We're goin' to the big city to see her, okay? (EXHAUST BACKFIRES) (MELODRAMATIC MUSIC) (MACHINE BLEEPS RHYTHMICALLY) (DOOR CREAKS) We've come to see how you are. (BED HUMS) Madre. We've come to see if you're well. They say you're very sick. Yeah, I didn't believe them. Did they tell you when you can leave, I mean, you must be eager to go? Can we get you anything? Okay. Maybe when we come back Sailboat. Write me a song on that little guitar. (PEACEFUL ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) SAILBOAT: Some things happen, so other things can happen. Jose. (MOODY ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) (PIPES RATTLE AND CLANG) I didn't know about songs. Yeah. SAILBOAT: But also, Peeti didn't know about soccer, until he did it all day. Yeah, Sailboat will write a song for Abuela. Then she'll go home. (BALL THUDS) Little crio makes me nervous near the stick. He has a problem with his eyes. (WOOD CREAKS) (CAR HORN HONKS) (MOODY ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) If I could blink, I could go for the team. Mm, but not many people can always keep their eyes open. A doctor can fix them, but it's a lot of money. Doctors have big houses and new wives. PEETI: I think boats would be a lot of money. It takes no money to look at them and think about them. Why do you think about them so much? Because I was born thinking about them. It is a boat? It is a sailboat. He's never seen a sailboat. Sailboat. (CHUCKLES) I used to draw them without stopping, but now I found this book that puts them in pictures, and the man brings a book when there's a new book. It's a free book. (MOODY ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) (BALL THUDS) (JOSE GRUNTS) (HOUSE CREAKS) (SNAKE HISSES) So! The ultimate adversary, defeated. Entoobed. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Enemy controlled. Humans are the real kings of the forest. You ever seen a lion entoob a snake? (CHUCKLES) I didn't think so. Since a million years ago, at the beginning of humans, (CHUCKLES) suprema, (GROANS) (CHILDREN LAUGH) Oh no, oh no. (CLATTERING) (GROANS) (UPBEAT ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) (BELL RINGS) (GUITAR STRUMS) SAILBOAT: My Abuela one day said, "It is important to sometimes see with other people's eyes." Maybe that day I needed Peeti's, because I didn't see the girl sneaking up to me and my little guitar. Not until she was all the way close. (BELL RINGS) (UPBEAT ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) I also didn't see the boy sneaking up. What you got here, Rowboat? These ones are very hot. BOY: Do it. Why's your guitar so stupid and little? Oh, my-- (BELL RINGS) JOSE: What happened to your little guitar? SAILBOAT: The hungry boy cut the strings. Where can we find this hungry boy? (MOODY ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) SAILBOAT: One time, the man who brought the letters told Mama to stop making the meatballs because she is a meatball, and Papa got a different look onto his face. The new man that brings the letters just smiles with no talking. After that, Mama didn't go out to people anymore. JOSE: Sailboat! SAILBOAT: Papa got that different look onto his face again. (HEAVY KNOCKS) Are you the guardian of the hungry boy who broke Sailboat's little guitar? Tommy! TOMMY: I'm playing Hippos! Tommy! TOMMY: Hippos! He might be a few minutes. Sir, can I get you anything? (UPBEAT ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) (TIRES SCREECH) (EXHAUST BACKFIRES) DJ: You're listenin' to Radio HQ. ♪ Radio HQ ♪ ATTENDANT: These ones here are pretty good. They the best? Are they the best? The best? Yeah, I can hear the gentleman just there. (SIGHS) If you want the best, you're gonna pay a bit more. These come with a redemption card for a free compact disk. They're $41. Do you take cards? ATTENDANT: No. Well, yeah. Today. I do. (EXHAUST BACKFIRES) (UPBEAT ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) (HOUSE CREAKS) (WOOD CREAKS) (JOSE CHUCKLES) (MOODY ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) (HOUSE CREAKS) SAILBOAT: After that, the boys at school just smiled with no talking. And my little guitar was back, ready for writing my Abuela's song. But not every day was a day for school. (HAMMERING THUDS) (MOODY ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) Sometimes when you think about someone, everything else goes to quiet. My Abuela one day said I am lucky, because I have two things I can think of like this. And in the quiet, I could think of some things for Abuela's song. Well, well, well, little man. Could set my clock to ya. I see you got yourself a new acquisition there. A little guitar, no less. You know what an acquisition is, little man? Well, it's somethin' you see and you, you just gotta have, and so, uh... So, you acquire it. Well, anyways, you ain't the only one been acquisitionin', as you might've noticed. Alright, you ready? Mm. Well, I got these three beautiful new babies right here! Startin' with the American dream, the Chavelle! Screamin' out for the road and a lifetime of erotic dreams! Girl on girl! But if that's not your cup of tea, then turn your loins to a truck made of meat, the '72 Chevy pickup. All the muscle in back for a girl, guy, guy, and if you's in between, and I most highly recommend you is, you might not even need a sponge cushion. But! If your desires are of a more serious kind, and I can see that they just might be, this last baby is a Chinese joss house on wheels! The Chevy G20 Sport van. Girl, guy, girl, guy, girl, and I could go on all day and night and I do believe that you could, too, given half a chance. So, what'd you think? I think that's your best one. I like the part about the truck made of meat. Yeah, I've been workin' on that all week. Tryin' to really capture the essence of the beast. Glad you like it. Yeah, I guess I'll leave you two alone. I don't know where you keep poppin' in from, little man, but I'm startin' to hope nobody ever comes for that thing. Don't know what anybody'd want with her out here anyways. Nearest water's gotta be 1,000 miles. But she was a good deal. Mighty fine deal. And a good deal's a good deal. (DOOR CLOSES) (MOODY ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) (BALL THUDS) (BIRD SQUAWKS) (BIRD SQUAWKS) SAILBOAT: Out in the quiet, I thought of some words for Abuela's song. (JOSE SPEAKS SPANISH) (JOSE SPEAKS SPANISH) But even in the quiet-- Meyo! (MEYO SPEAKS SPANISH) Has Sailboat returned from the boat yet? SAILBOAT: Papa was still thinking about the stick. Can you please get him to check the stick, please? (MEYO SPEAKS SPANISH) (JOSE SPEAKS SPANISH) Sailboat! Can you please check the stick, please? (JOSE SPEAKS SPANISH) (JOSE SPEAKS SPANISH) (DOOR CREAKS) There's a bug. (OMINOUS GUITAR CHORD) (MOODY ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) It's a wood ant. (CAR HORN HONKS) So, you got a problem with the white ants? Wood ant. Whites ants. Wood. Ant. Okay. Can I come in? (TRUNK RATTLES) Let's get down to business, I'm gonna show you what I got. (CHUCKLES) Here we go. (LAUGHS) Now, this guy is our base model. He was raised on the pallets. Now, given half a chance, he'll get the job done. You know, he's all instinct, he's just a little slow. But if you guys are really serious about this bidness, (CHUCKLES) (TRUNK RATTLES) I'd consider this guy right here. Now, he was raised on the white ants. He got a taste for that fire! (JOSE SPEAKS SPANISH) Wood ant. Oh. That's right, my bad. Listen, if you guys are serious about this pest control problem, then we gotta take it to the top level. (SIGHS) Here we go. (TRUNK RATTLES) This guy is your man right here. Now, he's gonna cost you a little bit extra, but he'll eat anything that moves. He's a serious guy. Sailboat. Fetch the special money. (MAN CHUCKLES) (UPBEAT ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) I'll write you up a receipt. (BIRD SQUAWKS) (CAR STARTS) (BIRD SQUAWKS) Appreciate the business, y'all take care now. (CHUCKLES) Sailboat! (BIRD SQUAWKS) Grab the string. Tie it up here. You got it? (BIRD SQUAWKS) Stand up. (BIRD SQUAWKS) (CHUCKLES) Tell that in your song for Abuela. (BIRD SQUAWKS) (WINGS FLAP) (TENSE ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) SAILBOAT: Mama said not to tell that in Abuela's song. (CAR HORN HONKS) (BIRD SQUAWKS) And Papa stayed at the stick all night. And even into the middle of the next day. (GUITAR STRUMS) (BIRD SQUAWKS) (GUN FIRES) Until he got a clear shot. (UPBEAT ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) (HOUSE CREAKS) I now had some words for my Abuela's song, and I started to think of some little guitar. When Mama said-- MEYO: Sailboat, some more papers have come with a record. PEETI: It's got changing colors. Hm? Is there music on that compact disk? PEETI: Contact disk. Contact. Well, you should find out. PEETI: Contact disk! (ASCENDING GUITAR NOTES) Contact! INSTRUCTOR: These notes represent one octave. Quando. (BRIGHT CHIME) Now think of a strong emotion. Hold it. Now find a note that represents this feeling. Follow this with notes that compliment this feeling. This is called music. Quando. (BRIGHT CHIME) Now consider these notes we have compiled for you. Quando. (BRIGHT CHIME) (MOODY ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) (BALL THUDS) (HOUSE CREAKS) I do believe that I perceive it just by being... (MACHINE BLEEPS RHYTHMICALLY) (HORSE NEIGHS) Jose. Jose. Jose? (HORSE NEIGHS) Did you finish making your song yet? No, but maybe manana, then we can take it to Abuela. Okay. (UPBEAT ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) Have you finished using my compact disk player? Mm, it was a good help. Contact disk. Was there any music on the compact disk? It was mostly a man teaching me some little guitar. Did you learn it? I wrote a song for my Abuela, she's sick. Do you know about songs? My father prefers the stylings of Ted Nugent and Suzie Quatro, but my favorite artists would have to be the Beatles and John Travolta. Maybe I can play to you my song and you can tell me about it? It would be my listening pleasure. SAILBOAT: My Abuela one day said, "Things can change." (SUSTAINED HIGH-PITCHED TONE) (HIGH-PITCHED GUITAR NOTE) That was the greatest song I've ever heard. The notes were, were all my memories. The melody was far superior to the Beach Boys, and your words were things nobody knows. I like that song. Water boy, very important. (EXHAUST BACKFIRES) (DOOR CLOSES) (HOUSE CREAKS) (BALL THUDS) Do you think we can go and see Abuela? The hospital left a message today. Your Abuela is very sick. But I finished my song for her. She's sleeping. We can go another time soon. Um, maybe you can practice her song for us to hear now. We would like to hear your song. (SUSTAINED HIGH-PITCHED TONE) (HIGH-PITCHED STRUM) (CHUCKLES) (JOSE AND MEYO CHUCKLE) (SPEAKS SPANISH) (BALL THUDS) (LOUD CLUNK) (HOUSE CREAKS) (WOOD SNAPS) (JOSE GROANS) (SMASHING AND CRASHING) (JOSE COUGHS) Sailboat? Sailboat! Mm? Is your little guitar okay? (GUITAR PLUCKS) (SAILBOAT SPEAKS SPANISH) That was a song from Dios. (HOUSE CREAKS) (HAMMERING THUDS) (GUN FIRES) (HOUSE CREAKS) We're taking that song to Abuela as soon as she gets awake. (BULLET HISSES) (TIN CLANGS) (PEACEFUL ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) (LAUGHS) (HORSE NEIGHS) (LAUGHS) (HORSE NEIGHS) (GUN FIRES) (LAUGHS) Sailboat! Your song gave me a magnificent dream. I was a horse hero, and I had a special seat to protect my culo from the bumps, and it was singing! You cul, your culo was singing? (JOSE SPEAKS SPANISH AND CHUCKLES) What was it singing? Your song! (UPBEAT ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) (LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) Your song also gave me this other magnificent dream! We were both riding close to the sky, I was on my black stallion and you were on this little... And uh, wait, let me get ya. (GRUNTS AND LAUGHS) Alright, get in, I'll tell you about the rest of it. SAILBOAT: I was happy Abuela's song was a happy song. And when Abuela heard it, she could be happy, too. Um, can you play me the song again today? Mm, I'll play you the song. You can come over. Papa does not care that you bent the house down. He's happy with dreams now. Can you play me the song again today? Mm, I'll play you the song. Molly, check. Maggie, check. Cyrus, check. Tommy, check. Blue Straps, check. Peeti, check. Yo, South of the Border, yippah! Come on. You're draggin'. Where's your papers? SAILBOAT: I forgot it when our house bent down. Are you the kid with the dad with the face? Uh, Jose, right? Mm. You want me to call him? Mm. Alright. Hey, Jose! (CHUCKLES) You know, I used to play a little guitar. Like this? (LAUGHS) No. No, not like that. So, what do you play, like Freebird or Stairway or, uh-- Yes, sir? Yeah, is this your boy? Ah, yes, sir. Would you mind if he goes on the day trip with us? May I ask where you're goin'? Tobacco. Tobacco. Tobacco. Tobacco. (MAN SPITS) Tobaccy. Tobacco. (UPBEAT ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) (EXCITED CHATTER) Oh, heck yeah! Ever since they got the paint done, woo-hoo! Livin' the dream. Feel that gun show, baby. Yes! Yeah, everybody wins! Yes! Ow, alright. Hey, whoa. Alright. Enough. Eyeballs, take your seat, South, why don't you play us a little somethin' to settle these kids down? Bon Bon Jovi, or whatever it is. I got control. Hey, did you hear me? I said play a little somethin', come on! Play that little guitar, buddy! Come on, Boat! (SUSTAINED HIGH-PITCHED TONE) (HITCH-PITCHED NOTE) What have you done, kid? (JOSE SIGHS) How was your day trip? Mr. Bing took away his hair. (CAR STARTS) (MOODY ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) Then some school people told some other people about Abuela's song. What you doin' with that big ol' bus round here, Alisa? (BACKGROUND SPORTS COMMENTARY) COMMENTATOR: That's all it took, one shot! He may not get up! Stumblin' around! (DOOR OPENS) Eight! Nine! (TAPE REWINDS) Got his hands way down. (DOOR CLOSES) Whoever thought we'd see this? Oh! That's all it took, one shot, he may not get up! I'm sorry. Will you come with me? (MEYO GIGGLES) (MEYO GASPS) Some people have come to the yard to Sailboat. (HOUSE CREAKS) (SUSTAINED HIGH-PITCHED TONE) (VISITORS APPLAUD) (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) Who, uh, were all these people in the yard just now? Those are some school people and some other people that came to hear my song. (JOSE CHUCKLES) Okay. (PEACEFUL ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) COMMENTATOR: He may not get up! Stumblin' around! Eight! Nine, can he make it, it's over, it's over! (UPBEAT ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) Hey, Sailboat, I had another dream. I was ridin' in the clouds, I was shooting my six-shooter even higher and higher, but it didn't shoot to six. It just kept on shooting, and everybody was there to celebrate. Was I there? Yeah! You were playing your song on your little guitar! Was Peeti there? Yeah. But I was forced to shoot his ball. (LAUGHS) Was Abuela there? (JOSE SPEAKS SPANISH) Maybe we can go and tell her about your dream and I can play her song for her? Yeah, but I think before we do that, we've gotta wait till Abuela's a little more rested. Hey, but you know, when Peeti was there, man, I shot his ball not once, I shot it twice! Pah, pah, pah! (LAUGHS) SAILBOAT: The next day, even some more people started to know about Abuela's song. Sailboat wrote a magic song. Sailboat wrote a song. (BOY WHISPERS) (BOY BREATHES) (BOY WHISPERS) Sailboat wrote a magic song. Sailboat wrote a magic song? Mm-hm. (BELL RINGS) Hi, Sailboat. You're like the boss. Bruce Springsteen. Bruce. Bruce. Hey, Sailboat. Are you gonna play again tonight? Mm. Oh, good. Okay. I might, um, yeah. (MOODY ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) You're Bruce Spring Clean. Steen. Bruce. SAILBOAT: And then they came to the outside. PEETI: Bruce! (BELL RINGS) SAILBOAT: Before Abuela's song, the people at school were mostly quiet to me. And then, after Abuela's song, they were again quiet to me. I think there are different ways of quiet. (CAR STARTS) Maybe after Abuela heard her song, the first quiet would come back. JOSE: You think more people are gonna come hear the song? SAILBOAT: Mm. (DOOR CLOSES) (VISITORS APPLAUD) There's more and more people. (DOOR CLOSES) (HOUSE CREAKS) SAILBOAT: Mama didn't go out to people anymore. (MAN CLEARS HIS THROAT) Woo! Man, that is a mighty hot meatball! But it's good, it's real good. Get yourself one, that's a good meatball. Woo! (UPBEAT ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) That's amazing, that's a complex heat. (CHUCKLES) Really good, thank you. Damn. (JOSE CHUCKLES) (JOSE CHUCKLES) Hey! (HOUSE CREAKS) Sometimes when you think about someone... Everything else goes to quiet. (BELL RINGS) (WATER SPLASHES) It's a long time before the game. Very important. Hey, guys. We got class. Come on. PEETI: Very important. Come on, guys. Let's go do some learnin'. (HOUSE CREAKS) (CALM ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) (CAR HORN HONKS) SAILBOAT: Sometimes you can do something for someone, and it can also be something for everyone. But really, it is something for someone. Everyone just forgot. (BELL RINGS) The Rattlesnakes. Where's Sailboat? (JOSE WHISTLES) (CAR HORN HONKS) SAILBOAT: But really... It is something... For someone. (WHISTLE BLOWS) For you leftovers playin' soccer this afternoon, you need to report to the locker room right after class. (WHISTLE BLOWS) (SUSPENSEFUL ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) (HOUSE CREAKS) DJ: And stay tuned to Radio HQ this afternoon 'cause we've got the one and only, Queen of the South, chattin' before her big show in town. ♪ Radio HQ ♪ Hey, there. What're you doin' all the way out here, kid? SAILBOAT: I'm going to the big city to see my Abuela. (CHUCKLES) The big city? I don't know what Abuela is, but I'm headin' back to the city. You can jump in, if you want. In fact, I insist. Get that. Put your seatbelt on. You're a long way from anywhere, kid. Woo, it's hot! Hot as hell and dry as a nun's gusset, and you're lucky, 'cause I ain't seen another car since I started out. And even I only ventured out this way on the rumor of an acquisition, you know what an acquisition is, kid? (CHUCKLES) Well, apparently it's when you see somethin' you just gotta have, so you acquire it! SAILBOAT: This is a good car. That's right, it's a hell of a car. SAILBOAT: My Papa has one just the same. Really? You have doors. Well, (CHUCKLES) yeah, it has doors. Anyways, don't you wanna know what I acquired? It's the weirdest thing, all the way out here. A sailboat! I know, I couldn't believe it! I mean, I had never seen one in the flesh. So, when I saw it, naturally I just had to have it. So, I acquired it! (LAUGHS) What's your name anyway, kid? You ain't gonna tell me your name? Sailboat. Yeah, I got a sailboat! Strangest thing! So, what is your name? Bruce Springsteen. Bruce Springsteen. I'll be, my lucky day. All the way out here in the desert and I find a Mexican kid with a little guitar named Bruce Springsteen. (CHUCKLES) Speakin' of which. What business you got with that little guitar anyways? (BALL THUDS) (CHILDREN YELL AND SCREAM) (MEYO SPEAKS SPANISH) Do you know what I do for a living, kid? Sir, what're you doin' here? I'm, uh, waitin' for Sailboat. We thought he left early to go home and prepare. Lotta people are comin' to hear him play the song. JOSE: Alright.

No. There's a lot of people out here. (MEYO SPEAKS SPANISH) Maybe he's out there already? Maybe you can help me take the albondigas and we can check for him? Okay. Rattlesnakes! Prairie Dogs! Play soccer ball! (WHISTLE CHIRPS) COACH: Ref! Come on! I have to go to Abuela. Whatever Abuela is, Bruce, I'll help you find it. But please, right now I need you to come with me. What you did back there... I mean... People have died waiting to hear such a thing. Look. I can make it worth your while, Bruce, I mean, whatever, whatever you want, what do you want?

(BACKGROUND CHATTER) Just this way, right here. There you go. Half-past three and when we get back, I'll be chattin'-- You ready to play, Bruce? You're listenin' to Radio-- Huh? ♪ Radio HQ ♪ Alright, you wait right here and I'll be right back, okay? Don't touch anything. Hey, there. Hey. Heard you this mornin', you were great.

I just have to hear it again. Where's the boy? ♪ Radio HQ ♪ Before the big show, we are lucky enough to have her right here in the studio. So, how the heck are you feelin'? Do you want me to play it? Oh, I feel great, you know. Yeah. To those people? Yeah. And then, can I go to Abuela? Bruce, I don't know what Abuela is. I wished I did. I wished I could help you. But I can't. I'm sorry. QUEEN OF THE SOUTH: Even just this mornin', I woke with this feelin', somethin' special was in the air, you know? JOSE: I don't get it, where could he be? MAN: It's him, it's him! SAILBOAT: And then everything, went to quiet. (MOODY ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) One day, I found something important. COACH: Come on! (WHISTLE BLOWS) Can you see this? PEETI: It's unusual! You can see the ball. I need you to get that ball. Do not pass it, you do not stop. You're not gonna need this. Sub! (RAIN SPLASHES) Go! You got it! (VISITORS CHEER) (WHISTLE BLOWS) (TRIUMPHANT HORN MELODY) SPECTATORS: Peeti, Peeti, Peeti, Peeti, Peeti! (VISITORS CHEER) (RAIN SPLASHES) (MACHINE BLEEPS RHYTHMICALLY) Oh. Hello. What are you doing here? I am here for my Abuela. (CHUCKLES) You can't be in here, little man. But she is waiting for me. Uh, no, she's not waiting for anybody. She's been in a coma for days. She's waiting for me to play my song. Uh, that may be so, but she can't hear you. Okay, but can you make it quick, please? (SUSTAINED HIGH-PITCHED TONE) SAILBOAT: I did get to play Abuela her song. She did not move. She did not say any words. But she was waiting. (MELANCHOLIC ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) Thank you. (SOBS) SAILBOAT: I did never play Abuela's song again. (UPBEAT ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) But the lady from the radio place who sings sent us a letter and now likes to sing the song on the radio. Sometimes she sends more letters and some money, and Papa can now buy us things. Sometimes you get a gift. Sometimes you give it to someone else. And sometimes it's not what anyone expected. Papa talked to the man who drove me to the city, and gave him some money for my sailboat. (JOSE SPEAKS SPANISH) No, thank you. SAILBOAT: Mama got a new gym suit and a new cooker that can fit more meatballs than we can ever have. (MEYO SPEAKS SPANISH) And the stick is now the best wood that wood ants cannot eat. Papa got the horse from his dreams, but it got hit by a bullet coming down. (GUN FIRES) So, he got another one. And the man who drove me to the city also did our deal. Now Papa's car has all the doors. (TIN CLANGS) ♪ Radio HQ ♪ MALE DJ: You're listenin' to Radio HQ, and like it has all month, my desk looks like Vegas on a power surge. Seems like you folks just can't get enough and I gotta say, if this ain't the greatest song I've ever heard, you can skin my hide and call me muscles. (CHUCKLES) So, folks, you've been asking for it round the clock, so here it is once again, the Queen of the South's version of, well, heck, you know what it is. Take it away.
