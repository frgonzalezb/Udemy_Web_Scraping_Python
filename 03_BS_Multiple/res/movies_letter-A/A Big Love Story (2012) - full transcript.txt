OH, WERE YOU PLANNING ON NOT HAVING A GOOD TIME TONIGHT? -NO, I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT. I'M JUST SURPRISED. -GOOD. I HAD A GOOD TIME, TOO. WHO IS THAT GUY? -STEPHAN. -THAT'S THE GUY FROM THE BOWLING ALLEY, RIGHT? -I HAVE TO GO TALK TO HIM. I'M SORRY. -YEAH, OKAY. COOL. -SO, WHAT, SEE YOU -- NOT TOMORROW BUT THURSDAY MORNING? -YEAH, BRIGHT AND EARLY. -THANK YOU. I HAD FUN. -LET ME GET THE DOOR FOR YOU. -OH, I GOT IT. THANK YOU. -FUCK. -BE READY, YOU'RE GOING TO REACH TO THE SIDES. YOU'RE GONNA REACH YOUR ARMS ON THE SIDES. REACH TO THE SIDES. GOOD. MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN... ALL THE WAY HIGH -- REACH. GOOD. VERY GOOD. FEEL IT -- TO THE SIDES. -I TRIED TO CALL YOU. -TURNED OFF MY PHONE. -WHAT'S IN THE BAG? -NOTHING. -YOU BLOW YOUR DATE? -WORSE, I GOT SWOOPED. YOU DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT? NO? COOL, ME NEITHER. -DON'T JUDGE ME, MEATBALL. -I'M SORRY ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT. -NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE. -I FEEL BAD ABOUT IT. -NAH, NO WORRIES. SO, UH, WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH HIM? -NOTHING, WE'RE JUST GOING THROUGH A ROUGH PATCH. -HMM. SEEMS KIND OF NERDY. THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT HIM. FOR THE MOST PART. -FOR THE MOST PART? WHAT'S THE SMALL PART YOU DON'T LIKE? HA! -I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS HE'S NEVER GONNA BE THE KIND OF GUY TO WIN ME A GIANT TEDDY BEAR AT A FAIR OR ANYTHING. I ALWAYS WIN THAT GIANT TEDDY BEAR. HECK, I AM A GIANT TEDDY BEAR. -YOU KNOW, IF YOUR KNEE DOESN'T HURT TO WALK ON IT, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO RUN ON IT. -REALLY? IT STILL FEELS A LITTLE TIGHT. -YEAH, WELL, I THINK THAT'S MOSTLY IN YOUR HEAD. YOU SHOULD GET THE DOCTOR TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN. -YEAH. -SO, YOU READY FOR A JOG? -YEAH. -ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. YOUR KNEE IS FINE. COME ON. COME ON. REALLY? THIS IS AS FAST AS YOU CAN GO? -I'M MOVING. I'M TELLING YOU, I THINK YOUR KNEE IS FINE. -I'M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN. -FINE. -SO, WHY DID YOU GIVE UP FOOTBALL? -WHILE I WAS REHABBING, MY MOTHER DIED, AND -- I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS BECAUSE SHE GAVE UP EVERYTHING TO RAISE ME. SHE WORKED, LIKE, THREE JOBS, HAD NO LIFE. I JUST REALLY WANTED TO MAKE IT TO THE NFL SO I COULD PAY HER BACK. BUT AFTER SHE DIED, I JUST STOPPED PLAYING 'CAUSE SHE JUST WASN'T THERE. -HOW DID SHE DIE? -HEART ATTACK. SHE WAS BIG LIKE ME. -WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD? -CAR ACCIDENT WHEN I WAS 10. A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF GRANDPA'S COUGH SYRUP AT THE WHEEL. -DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER FAMILY? -MM. MEATBALL. -WHAT'S A MEATBALL? IT'S SOMETHING YOU PUT IN SPAGHETTI. IT'S DELICIOUS. IT'S ALSO MY GOLDFISH. -SO, WHAT DO YOU DO ON HOLIDAYS? -HANG OUT WITH FRIENDS FOR THANKSGIVING. DON'T REALLY CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS. -HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? I'M JEWISH, AND EVEN I CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS. WELL, WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FAMILY, IT MAKES THE GIFT GIVING A LITTLE ONE SIDED. BUT THAT MAKES ME THE PERFECT CANDIDATE TO BECOME A C.I.A. AGENT... OR A NINJA. SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING LATER TONIGHT? -NO PLANS. YOU? -WANT TO SEE A MOVIE... JUST AS FRIENDS? -JUST AS FRIENDS? -JUST AS FRIENDS. -OKAY. -YES! -JUST AS FRIENDS. -JUST AS FRIENDS. -KEVIN COSTNER. -ADAM SANDLER. -HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT? THAT'S FOUR OUT OF FOUR. YOU'RE GOOD AT THIS. -I'M ABOUT TO BE FIVE FOR FIVE -- "TITANIC." -OH, THAT DOESN'T COUNT. IT'S ALWAYS "TITANIC." -JUST SO YOU KNOW, ABOUT 20 MINUTES INTO THE FILM, I'M GONNA DO THE OLD ARM-AND-YAWN MOVE. -THANKS FOR THE HEADS-UP. I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST HERE AS FRIENDS. -YEAH, FRIENDS. OF COURSE. THAT'S WHY I WAS GIVING YOU THE FRIENDLY WARNING. -OH, THANK YOU. ANY OTHER SURPRISES IN STORE FOR ME THIS EVENING? -NOPE, THAT'S ALL I GOT. SADLY, THIS IS MY "A" GAME. THAT IS SAD. MAYBE YOU SHOULD -- -YOU DON'T TALK DURING THE PREVIEWS? -NEVER. -GOD, YOU WENT THROUGH SO MUCH TROUBLE TO MAKE ALL OF THIS. HOW CAN I MAKE IT UP TO YOU? LET'S EAT, AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT A WAY. CHIN CHIN. -WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING BACK HERE? -GETTING SOME EXTRA CARDIO IN. -HOW DID THE THING WITH CASSIE GO? -WHAT? -HOW DID THE THING WITH CASSIE GO? -AWESOME! -YEAH? -IT'S SO WEIRD 'CAUSE WE'RE SO OPPOSITE IN SO MANY WAYS. -RIGHT, YOU'RE FAT, SHE'S SKINNY. YOU LOVE HER, SHE HATES YOU. YEAH. -RIGHT, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE LIKES HANGING OUT WITH ME, BUT I FIGURE, DON'T ASK. -IT'S KIND OF OBVIOUS. -WHAT DO YOU MEAN? -DADDY ISSUES. -HUH? -NO? OKAY, PICTURE THIS. AVERAGE GUY IS WALKING DOWN THE STREET. HE'S WALKING BY ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, AND ALL HE'S THINKING ABOUT IS TRYING TO HOOK UP, FEEL UP, SCREW, BANG, DATE -- WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. ONE DAY, HE FINALLY SNAGS ONE, LOCKS IT DOWN, GETS MARRIED, THE WHOLE NINE YARDS. BANG! WIFEY SHOOTS OUT A KID, BUT NOT JUST A KID -- A BABY GIRL. WELL, WHAT IN THE HELL IS HE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS? THIS IS THE SAME TYPE OF CREATURE HE WAS JUST TRYING TO NAIL A FEW MONTHS AGO. NOW HE'S SUPPOSED TO RAISE IT? HOW? WELL, SINCE HE'S A DUDE, HE DOES WHAT MOST DUDES DO AND IGNORES IT, YOU KNOW, LIKE LAUNDRY. BUT IT KEEPS GROWING, AND EVENTUALLY IT TURNS INTO THIS PRE-TEEN SHE-DEMON HORMONAL BITCH. ADIóS, PAPA BEAR, AND HELLO, DADDY ISSUES. SO, WHAT'S THE ISSUE? SHE WANTS A DADDY WHO LOVES HER. EVERY GIRL DOES. AND WHEN SHE DOESN'T GET THAT, SHE STARTS PLAYING THIS TWISTED GAME WHERE SHE FINDS ANY GUY THAT REMINDS HER OF HER FATHER AND TRIES TO DO WHATEVER SHE CAN TO EARN HIS AFFECTION. THIS IS WHY YOU SEE HOT CHICKS WITH JACKASSES. SHE'S CONVINCED IF SHE CAN JUST GET THAT GUY TO LOVE HER, IT'D BE THE SAME FEELING AS HAVING HER OWN DADDY LOVE HER. OF COURSE, IT NEVER WORKS OUT THAT WAY. SHE JUST ENDS UP IN A STRING OF BAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH DUDES THAT ARE IDIOTS. I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE AN IDIOT. I'M JUST SAYING THERE'S AN OBVIOUS MISMATCH BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU. SO A LOGICAL CONCLUSION IS THAT CASSIE HAS SOME DADDY ISSUES. NOW YOU MIGHT THINK THIS IS FINE BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING TO DATE SOME HOT CHICK WAY OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE, BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. THE ULTIMATE GOAL FOR THESE GIRLS IS TO GET SOME REVENGE. ONCE SHE GETS A GUY LIKE YOU TO LOVE HER, SHE'S GONNA TAKE CONTROL AND WALK OUT, JUST LIKE HER FATHER DID. -WOW. -YEP. -SPEAKING OF FATHERS... HOW ARE THINGS WITH YOU AND LaSHAWNA? -THEY'RE GOOD. THEY'RE GOOD. THEY'RE REALLY GOOD. UM, WE DECIDED TOGETHER THAT WE'RE GONNA KEEP IT -- KEEP THE BABY -- SO... -WOW. CONGRATULATIONS. -YEAH. YEAH. OF COURSE, IF IT'S A GIRL, IT'S GONNA HAVE MAJOR DADDY ISSUES. IT WAS A...JOKE. GO AHEAD AND RUN. I'LL SEE YA. -YAY! -YEAH, I DON'T KNOW. OH. -ALL RIGHT, ONE MORE SET. -WHAT ARE YOU DOING SUNDAY NIGHT? -NOTHING. YOU? YOU WANT TO GO OUT? -SURE. YOU WANT TO SEE A MOVIE? -A DATE. -WHAT? -A REAL DATE. NOT AS FRIENDS. A DATE DATE. -OH. I DON'T KNOW, SAM. I KIND OF LIKE THE WAY THINGS ARE NOW. -I'M JUST SO CONFUSED. WE HAVE A GOOD TIME TOGETHER. -WE DO. -IF IT'S MY WEIGHT, YOU KNOW I'M TRYING TO WORK IT OFF. -IT'S NOT THAT. -WHAT IS IT THEN? -I JUST FEEL LIKE THINGS ARE UNFINISHED WITH STEPHAN. -WELL, YOU'RE NOT SEEING HIM NOW. I KNOW 'CAUSE I SEE YOU EVERY DAY. -NO, BUT I KNOW OUR RELATIONSHIP, AND WE'RE GONNA GET BACK TOGETHER. -WELL, YOU'RE NOT TOGETHER NOW. WE STILL HAVE TIME TO GO ON ONE DATE. AND IF IT'S HORRIBLE, WE'LL FORGET THIS THING EVER HAPPENED. BUT IF IT'S GOOD... ALL RIGHT, ONE DATE. -YES! ARE YOU GONNA GET A NEW OUTFIT? -NO. MAYBE. NO. NO. CAN YOU JUST DO 10 MORE, PLEASE? -OKAY. HEY, DUDE. -WHAT'S UP? -GUESS WHO'S GOT A DATE WITH CASSIE TONIGHT? -HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE. WELL, THIS TIME IT'S OFFICIAL OFFICIAL. -RIGHT. -IT IS. -WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? -WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? -AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING THE FRONT DESK TODAY? -I SWITCHED WITH WENDY. -YOU'RE HAVING A KID. -SHH. YEAH, THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME. ANYWAY... -BE SMART, MILES. LaSHAWNA LOVES YOU. SHE'S GONNA BE THE MOTHER OF YOUR CHILD. IT WOULDN'T HURT YOU TO TRY TO MAKE THIS RELATIONSHIP WORK. -YOU'RE RIGHT. IT WOULDN'T HURT ME. THANK YOU, DR. SAM. -ALL I'M SAYING IS, DON'T PRESS THE NUCLEAR BUTTON JUST BECAUSE YOU RAN OVER A FEW SPEED BUMPS. -I'M HAVING A KID. THAT'S A NUCLEAR BOMB. SO THAT BUTTON HAS ALREADY BEEN PUSHED -- REALLY HARD. AND THERE ARE CERTAIN TRUTHS TO LIFE, LIKE I'M GONNA SCREW UP FATHERHOOD. YOU'RE GONNA SCREW UP THIS THING WITH CASSIE. TYSON'S GONNA SCREW ANY GIRL HE WANTS, MOST LIKELY WITH HIS SHIRT OFF. IT'S JUST THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS, MAN. YOU GOT TO ROLL WITH IT. -I'M NOT GONNA SCREW THIS THING UP WITH CASSIE. -RIGHT. PROVE ME WRONG. I GOTTA PISS. -I'M NOT GONNA SCREW THIS THING UP WITH CASSIE! I'M NOT. -LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT THE WRONG BATHROOM.. UNLESS YOU WANT TO USE ONE OF THOSE... WHICH I DON'T RECOMMEND. -SO... UH... AH, THE OL' ZIPPER. UP AND DOWN. ZIPPER. -ZIPPER. -ZIPPER GOES UP AND DOWN. -♪ I JUST CAN'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE ♪ - AND DOWN. -♪ BUT I'M NOT QUITE OVER YOU ♪ I GUESS I'M NOT QUITE OVER YOU ♪ ♪ AND ALL THE PAIN YOU PUT ME THROUGH ♪ -OH, ROUGH. -♪ BUT AS YOU DRAG MY HEART ALONG... ♪ I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I CAN'T DO THIS. -WHY NOT? -I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND. -SO? -NO, NO, NO. THERE'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW -- SHE'S PREGNANT. - SO? - WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. I WANT TO MAKE IT WORK WITH HER. SO... SORRY. YOU WANT, UH -- YEAH, THIS IS YOURS, YEAH. THIS -- WHAT? UM, THANK YOU. I HATE YOU. YEAH. -I'M NOT GONNA SCREW UP MY DATE WITH CASSIE! I'M GONNA BLOW IT WITH CASSIE, HUH? -YOU'RE GONNA DO FINE, OKAY? LISTEN TO ME. IF I CAN TURN DOWN A CRAZY-ASS DRUNK GIRL IN A BATHROOM, YOU CAN HANDLE A LITTLE DATE. AH, TA-DA. HUH? -IT'S A DRINK. -ITA DRINK. I FIGURE YOU HAVE ONE, MAYBE LOOSEN YOU UP A BIT. BUT JUST ONE, OKAY? -WHOA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? -I LIVE HERE. -YOU HAVE TO EXCUSE MY IRRATIONAL, PREGNANT GIRLFRIEND, SAM. -REALLY? -YEAH, YOU GONNA WALK AROUND IN YOUR UNDERWEAR LIKE THAT? -WELL, YEAH, I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING HE AIN'T SEEN BEFORE. YOU HA SEEN A GIRL IN HER UNDERWEAR BEFORE, RIGHT? -OF COURSE HE HAS, AND HE WILL AGAIN TONIGHT. RIGHT? SEE, HONEY, SAM HERE IS NERVOUS AS SHIT, SO I FIGURE IF WE HAVE A LITTLE DRINK, IT'LL LOOSEN HIM UP A BIT. -THAT'S A BAD IDEA. -A BAD IDEA, I KNOW. IT'S AN AWFUL IDEA, BUT IT'S THE ONLY ONE I'VE GOT. -EXACTLY. -JUST ONE DRINK. -ONE DRINK. -SUCH A BAD IDEA. -WE'RE DOING IT. ONE DRINK. -JUST ONE DRINK. -ONE DRINK. -ONE DRINK. -ARE YOU OKAY, SAM? -I'M FINE, CASSIE. YOUR NAME HAS "ASS" IN IT. WHAT A MIGHTY FINE ONE YOU HAVE. YOUR ASS, NOT YOUR NAME. YOUR NAME IS KIND OF WEIRD. -ARE WE READY TO ORDER? -YES. I WOULD LIKE THE CAESAR SALAD TO START, AND THEN I WILL HAVE THE FILET MEDIUM RARE, AND CAN YOU HOLD THE GREEN, SPINACHY STUFF THAT COMES ON THE SIDE? I DON'T WANT THAT. BUT I WILL DOUBLE UP ON THE CREAMY MASHED POTATOES. THANK YOU. -VERY GOOD. AND FOR THE LADY? -I WILL HAVE A GRILLED CHICKEN AND SOME ASPARAGUS, PLEASE. JUST NO SAUCE ON THE ASPARAGUS. -PERFECT. AND CAN I GET SOMETHING FOR YOU TO START WITH? -NO, THANK YOU. -HAVE YOU DECIDED ON A BOTTLE OF WINE? -I THINK WE'RE OKAY. -...TO ORDER ONE! WHY DON'T YOU GO GET US A BOTTLE OF RED, HUH? SOMETHING EASY ON THE WALLET, KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? THIS THING AIN'T GUARANTEED? -I THINK THAT I DO. I'LL JUST BRING YOU THE HOUSE CAB, OKAY? -PER-FECT. -OKAY, I'LL BE BACK WITH YOUR WINE. YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST KIDDING ON THE WHOLE "NOT GUARANTEED" THING. HEY, REMEMBER WHEN I SAID "SAH-LAD" LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT? THAT WAS FUNNY. I'M REALLY FUNNY. -SAM, WHAT'S GOING ON? -I DON'T KNOW. YOU TELL ME -- WHAT IS GOING ON? -I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO HAVE A NICE DINNER. -I THOUGHT WE WERE. -YOU'RE DRUNK. -YEAH, BUT YOU CAN CATCH UP. YOU KNOW, THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION. WHAT IS GOING ON? WHY ARE YOU OUT HERE WITH ME? -YOU ASKED ME OUT. -AND YOU SAID YES BECAUSE...? WHAT? DO YOU FEEL BAD FOR ME? -HERE WE ARE. I THINK YOU TWO WILL LIKE THIS. IT'S GOT A SLIGHT PEPPER TASTE, SO IT'LL GO WELL WITH YOUR STEAK AND YOUR CHICKEN. OKAY? IT'S EASY ONT HE WALLET, AS WELL. -AH! GREAT. -I'M OKAY, THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, I-I THINK I'M ACTUALLY GONNA GET OUT OF HERE, IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU. YEP. I REMIND YOU OF YOUR FATHER, RIGHT? -WHAT? -HE USED TO PLAY FOOTBALL, PROBABLY DRANK TOO MUCH. -YES, AND HE WAS AN ASSHOLE, JUST LIKE YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW. WHAT IS YOUR POINT? -MY POINT IS, YOU JUST WANT TO RELIVE YOUR FAILED RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. BUT THIS TIME, YOU JUST WANT TO TAKE CONTROL AND WALK OUT. -MY FAILED RELATIONSHIP? SAM, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? -YOU'RE TRYING TO USE ME TO SOLVE YOUR DADDY ISSUES. -YES, AND THAT ALL MAKES SENSE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU WERE A LOUSY DRUNK OR AN ASSHOLE UNTIL TONIGHT. AND THE FACT IS, SAM, YOU'RE NOT A FOOTBALL PLAYER. YOU WORK AT A BOWLING ALLEY, WHICH IS FINE. AND DESPITE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE TONIGHT, I KNOW YOU'RE A REALLY NICE GUY. SO IN REALITY, NO, YOU'RE REALLY NOTHING LIKE MY FATHER. PERHAPS YOU SHOULD START LOOKING AT YOUR OWN ISSUES BEFORE YOU START TELLING OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THEIRS. AND FOR THE RECORD, I CAME HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE I ACTUALLY LIKE YOU -- JUST THE WAY YOU ARE. -HOW ARE WE DOING? -I'M LEAVING. -SHOULD I HOLD HER ORDER THEN? -NO. YOU CAN BRING IT. I'LL EAT IT, TOO. SHE HAS DADDY ISSUES. WOMEN. MEATBALL... MEATBALL? MEATBALL! MEATBALL, LOOK AT ME. MEATBALL, I'VE BEEN STARVING YOU THIS WHOLE TIME, BUDDY. IT'S NOT YOU THAT HAS TO GO ON A DIET, IT'S ME.

I'M GONNA GO EAT IT. SHIT. HEY. -HEY. -I CAME TO APOLOGIZE. -YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO. -LOOK, I MESSED UP. I'M SORRY. -IT'S OKAY. -IT'S JUST EVERYTHING WAS GOING SO GOOD, BUT I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT GOING OUT WITH YOU, AND I WANTED TO IMPRESS YOU, SO... I STARTED DRINKING. -APOLOGY ACCEPTED. -WE HAD FUN. -YEAH, WE DID. -A BUNCH OF US ARE PLAYING POKER AT MY HOUSE LATER, IF YOU WANT TO COME. -SURE. -SO, I'LL SEE YOU THEN? -OKAY. -OKAY. -IT'S A FIVE-CARD DRAW, KIDS, SO GET LOOSE AND COMFORTABLE. THAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME -- LOOSE AND COMFORTABLE. -SO, HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU, ANYWAYS? -GOTTA BE AT LEAST SIX MONTHS. -WE DON'T KNOW YET, OKAY? WE JUST GOT ALL THAT INSURANCE STUFF WORKED OUT. BUT WE HAVE OUR FIRST DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT TOMORROW! -THAT'S RIGHT -- WE HAVE OUR FIRST DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT TOMORROW. I'M NOT LETTING HER GO ALONE. I'VE SEEN PORNOS. I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. TYSON, YOU CAN BACK ME UP ON THIS. -YEAH, FOR SURE. -YOU GUYS ARE DUMB-ASSES. -IT'S OKAY, SAM. YOU INVITED HER. I'M SURE SHE'LL COME. -YEAH. -THANK YOU SO MUCH, HONEY, FOR BEING HERE.

OKAY, WELL, WE RAN THE BLOOD TESTS, AND WE DID THE TEST HERE, AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU, LaSHAWNA, ARE NOT PREGNANT. -EXCUSE ME? -IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT. -NO, IT LOOKS LIKE LaSHAWNA IS PREGNANT. THAT'S WHY LaSHAWNA'S HERE, BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S PREGNANT. -IT'S OKAY. HOLD ON. JUST LET ME JUMP IN ON THIS. UM, SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S NO KID IN THERE? -AT THE MOMENT, LaSHAWNA IS, UH, TOTALLY KID FREE. -OKAY, UM... BUT I'M SHOWING THE SYMPTOMS, SO... -WELL, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, THERE CAN BE A LOT OF REASONS FOR SYMPTOMS LIKE, UH, TENDER NIPPLES, VOMITING, CRAVINGS. -LIKE WHAT? -WELL, AN UNHEALTHY DIET, FOR STARTERS. -SO, DOCTOR, LET ME JUST BE 100% WITH THIS. AIN'T NOTHING IN THERE? -NOTHING. WELL, I'M SORRY. I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE. -THANK YOU, DOCTOR. YOU OKAY? -I WILL BE. -COME HERE. SORRY. -IT'S FINE.

AND I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY GONNA SOUND STUPID TO YOU, BUT I WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF LOOKING FORWARD TO IT, NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT. -YOU'D BE A HORRIBLE FATHER, MILES. YOU EVEN SAID SO YOURSELF. -FUCK YOU. I'M SURE I WOULD SUCK, BUT YOU HAVE TO TRY, RIGHT? OTHERWISE, WHAT'S THE POINT? YOU GET THAT, RIGHT? -LEAVE A FLOWER, SAM. DON'T TRY TOO HARD. OKAY, BIG FELLA. LET'S DO THIS. -OH, OH, PERFECT. EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. COULD I ASK A HUGE FAVOR? -SURE. -THAT'S A GIANT TEDDY BEAR. -YEAH. -YOU WORK AT THE BOWLING ALLEY, DON'T YOU? -RIGHT. I KNEW I RECOGNIZED YOU.

OH, I NEVER THOUGHT THIS DAY WOULD COME. HE'S JUST INSIDE GETTING HER. JUST, OKAY... -OKAY, SHE'S COMING OUT ANY SECOND. SHE'S JUST PUTTING ON HER SHOES.

NEITHER PYTHAGORAS, DESCARTES, NOR MADAME CURIE CAN CALCULATE STEPHAN'S AFFLICTION FOR THEE, CASSIE. NOW PLEASE RULE OUT THE PROBABILITIES AND AGREE TO SINE AND COSINE THIS LIFELONG DECREE. SO I ASK YOU NOW ON BENDED KNEE... CASSIE -- SIGN -- WILL YOU MARRY STEPHAN TODAY? -WELL? -YES. -OH! OH, THIS IS WHAT MAKES A MOTHER SO PROUD! -I'M GONNA GO GET SOME FOOD. -HEY, EVERYBODY! WE'RE GETTING MARRIED! -MILES! LaSHAWNA! ASSHOLES! ASSHOLE, YOU READY FOR ME? BITCH. QUITTER! YOU FUCKING QUITTER! MEATBALL! -IT'S OUR -- WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS? -ENGAGEMENT. -OUR ENGAGEMENT. WE'RE GETTING MARRIED. -CONGRATS. -I'M STILL IN DISBELIEF THAT YOU SAID YES. THIS IS A HAPPY DAY. ARE YOU HAPPY? -I'M HAPPY. -I KNOW MY MOM IS HAPPY. SHE'S HOPING I'LL MOVE OUT NOW. OH, JESUS. -WHAT? -THEY'RE DOING THAT STUPID KARAOKE THING. THIS IS WHERE YOU AND I MAKE SUCH A GOOD PAIR. YOU WOULD NEVER SEE ONE OF US UP THERE MAKING A FOOL OF OURSELVES. -YEAH. -SORRY, I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY DID THIS HERE. MUST BE A SPECIAL NIGHT THING. -THAT'S OKAY. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

I'M NOT...ENGAGED -- ANYMORE. -YOU'RE NOT ENGAGED? -NO. -WHAT HAPPENED? -HE JUST WASN'T THE RIGHT GUY FOR ME, YOU KNOW? -CRAZY. -YES, WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS SOME MADNESS IN LOVE, BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME REASON IN MADNESS. -FRED PIZZA. -FRED PIZZA. SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? -UH, UM...I WAS WONDERING -- DO YOU WANT TO GET THAT CUP OF COFFEE? -YES. -WAIT, I WASN'T READY FOR THAT. CAN WE KISS AGAIN? -YEAH. -WAIT A SECOND. WHERE'D YOU GET THAT? -OH, WELL, I FOUND HIM ON THE STREET OUTSIDE OF MY HOUSE, BUT HE WAS SO CUTE AND BIG AND FLUFFY, I JUST HAD TO KIND OF TAKE HIM IN. HOW ABOUT WE HAVE THAT CUP OF COFFEE HERE? -REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I MENTIONED THE WHOLE DADDY ISSUE THING AND HOW CASSIE WOULD DEFINITELY LEAVE SAM? WELL, MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE OFF. OKAY, I WAS -- I WAS WAY OFF. AS IT TURNS OUT, CASSIE WAS SOMEHOW ABLE TO SEE BEYOND SAM'S SLIGHTLY CHUBBY EXTERIOR. AND WHILE SAM WORKED OFF THE OLD POUNDS ONE AT A TIME -- LIKE REALLY SLOWLY -- CASSIE STUCK AROUND. I GUESS FOR HER, SAM IS WORTH THE WAIT.
