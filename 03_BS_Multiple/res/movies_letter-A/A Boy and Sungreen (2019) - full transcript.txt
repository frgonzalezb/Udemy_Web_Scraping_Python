foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- I slept so well. Did you cry? Uh, no. Yes you have. I can see tear streaks. How can you fall asleep to a movie that you picked? You have to sleep a bit with these movies. Huh? I know that guy. Who is he? He is always at the movies. Always dressed the same, a total geek. Doesn’t that mean you’re always here too? You always dress the same too. Wait up. So, how does the movie end? What’s the last thing you saw? Where that guy suddenly dies. That’s basically the beginning. A BOY AND SUNGREEN Here you go. I’ll get going. Oops! Oh my goodness. Put this in the kitchen. I’m off. Where are you? Home. Is your mom out? Just now. Be there in 5 minutes. See you in 10 minutes then. Calling from the toilet again? Dr. Moon, M.D. OBGYN On a hot summer day, a healthy girl weighing 4.4kg was born in Seoul. Perhaps due to the baby’s huge head, her mother died in labor. On the way home, her father saw the bright sun and green leaves and named her Nok-yang(Sungreen). I was born here. Don’t mess about here. I’m not messing about. Hey, hurry up! Wow. He’s so hot. He’s so handsome. - Same day, the ward next door, - Doctor, how old are you? a boy was born and put in an incubator Where are you going? He was as sensitive as he was fragile. LEE Bo-hee, wait up. You’re embarrassing me. Why would you go in there? His mother named him Bo-hee for reasons of her own, and perhaps it was inevitable that he’d get an unusual nickname. LEE Bo-ji*! (*Synophone meaning pussy) Give it here! I’m going to delete it. Fine, it’s not the original anyway. Then take this word out. What word? What you said just now. Bo-ji? Nope. It’s very important. What are you on about? Nobody calls me that. LEE Bo-ji. Quit your flirting! So what comes next? I don’t know yet. But I’m planning on filming you first. No thanks. Don’t be such a whiner. What are you gonna do with it when you’re done? Do I must do something? For now, I’m gonna film a lot of stuff. Then by the time I graduate, I’ll have a whole movie made. Since, as you know, I suck at studying. What if this film kicks ass, and I get invited to Cannes? I can’t even afford plane tickets. Bo-hee, what’s wrong? Are you okay? Give me a sec. I don’t want to go home. Why not? Because Gran is always nagging. I’d still like to have a granny. I’m hungry. Do you have to go home soon? Want some? No, it gets all over your hands. Why do you like that so much? Just cause. What? Be quiet. - But your face is all red. - I’m fine. Who is that guy? - In that case... - Let’s go. Where to? - I know a place. - Watch your step here. Wow, a boyfriend? No. Let’s follow them. Hey! Wait up. Sweetie, did I wake you? Mom. Yes. Who were you with earlier? You saw? Why didn’t you say hi? He is a regular at my shop. Do you like that guy? What? He’s just a friend. You don’t want me to get a boyfriend? Did your mom really get a boyfriend? Will you then get a stepdad? What stepdad? I’ll run away then. Isn’t it a good thing? Would you like to get a stepmom? You crazy? She’ll nag me to death. Granny is more than enough. I don’t want one either. What if they get rid of you first? You know, like in fairy tales, stepmoms are mean to their stepkids. Then I’ll really run away for sure. And go where? You don’t even have a granny. I have an older sister. Bo-hee, say hello to Nam-hee. What? My sister’s number. What sister? The one Dad brought home. Where did you get it? Mom’s phone. So you will mooch off her? We have the same dad. I’m sure she won’t just ignore me. She’d hate you. Her dad remarried. No, she didn’t hate me. She was nice to me. Well done. Hey. Let’s just call and see. Now? Hold on. You can’t call her. Hello. Is this Miss LEE Nam-hee? Hello, we’re calling from KT because you’re the winner of our promotion. Before we send you the prize, could you verify your address? I asked you to hurry, but you had to make me come all the way here. And put on some pants. You’re embarrassing me. It’s your voice that’s embarrassing. Is that you Bo-hee? Who is he? Bo-hee! Bo-hee, you okay? Are you okay? Do CPR or something! Come on! - Here! - I’m fine! It happens sometimes. Are you really all right? How did you get here? Is something wrong? How have you been? No, just you know. I’m sorry but it’s almost my flight time. For now, go to the hospital with him. Who is he? Doesn’t matter. I’ll check later. Bo-hee. You’ve gotten so big by the way. Sir. I don’t need to go to the hospital. Sorry to bother you. I’ll get going. Hey. Who are you? Sorry? You and Nam-hee. What is she to you? I think I’m her half-brother. What? Nam-hee’s parents passed when she was young. Before Dad died, he brought Nam-hee home when I was little. Aren’t you her cousin? She said she lived with an uncle when she was little. Then we don’t have the same dad? That’s right. Nam-hee never said her uncle died. My dad passed away in an accident when I was a kid. - Mom. - Yes. Why don’t we have photos of Dad? He passed away when you were little. It was a very long time ago. What was his job? Just an office worker. How did he pass away? I told you, in an accident. Tell me more. I’m all grown up now. I’ll tell you when you’re older. - Then, how did you meet him? - Bo-hee. I’m really tired. Eat up and go to your room. You always say you’re tired. When all you do is get drunk with men. What did you just say? What? Yes, I drank a little. Because raising you alone is hard. Do I need your permission to drink now? Then why did you bother raising me? You think I wanted to? Watch what you say. If you’re going to be like this, get out of this house! Your sister is living with a man? Holy cow. Yeah, they’re living together. I heard something strange. What? Maybe, just maybe. What is it? I think my dad could be alive. Your dad? He passed away. Maybe not. Holy cow. So, your mother lied to you? I think so. Wow, this is big. Look at me. Just stop. Wait for me. Hi, Bo-hee. Hello. Your mom’s gone already. Yeah? - Is he the owner’s son? - Yes. Hello. You’re a handsome kid. Must take after your mother. You must be happy that you might get a dad soon. Sorry? What? Hey. Coming home from school? Say hello. He’s my customer. Hi, I heard a lot about you. He is talking to you. Mom. Why did you lie to me? About what? Bo-hee! Bo-hee! Mom Who is it? - You again? - Yes. Is Nam-hee here? She’s not picking up the phone. She went on a flight. A flight? She’s a flight attender. You mean flight attendant. Call and come back next week. What? It’s just that... What? Did you run away? No, I told Mom I’m going to a friend’s. - Your mom told you off? - No. Do you smoke? No. Drink? Then why did you run away? Whatever. Can you come back tomorrow? I have to go to work now. Stay put until I get back, okay? When will you come back? Do I have to sleep alone? Do I have to watch you sleep? If you can’t sleep, clean the place. Okay. See you later. Letter? A letter in the 21st century? Not even a name on it. I can’t be sure, but I think it’s from Dad. Why? Just a feeling. I heard the only family she has is an uncle. Do you remember your dad’s face? No, strangely I remember everything but his face. Let’s go find out. Find out what? Your Dad. Aren’t you curious? I am, but he didn’t even write me. Never came to visit. Well, he must’ve had his reasons. What reasons? Like going to prison. Let’s go. The safety doors are opening. Hello. My name is LEE Bo-hee. Dad, it’s me Bo-hee. Why aren’t you coming? Maybe this is pointless. Let’s just go eat then. I’m starving to death. Are you mad? Why would I be? Sorry. I don’t know what to say when I meet him. Then, speak into this. Like you’re making a video message. Okay. Go. What? Are you gonna throw my phone again? No. Hello, my name is LEE Bo-hee. Can’t you get it right? Put it away. I’m not doing it. Let’s go. Is this it? It’s not a LEE. Did you see? - Kinda. - You think that’s your dad? I really can’t tell. What should we do? This place is amazing. You can even see Namsan. Hey, what’s that? That! Arabian Nights? Come here! What should we do? I don’t know. How old are you two? We're in seventh grade. Soo-min didn’t live here very long. Is the sender’s name Soo-min? Yes. LEE Soo-min. I think. I’m not good with names. Do you know where he went? Don’t know. He left in a hurry. What do you do for a living? An actor. Now, just unemployed. Is he an actor too? No, to be an actor, he’s a little too... A little too what? Ugly. Just joking. Didn’t know he had a son. Does he look like him? Yup. Looks like my son. No, not your son. Does he have any noticeable traits? He took lots of photos. And he drew too. This boy can draw too. That’s amazing. Sir, is there a way to find my dad? I think I have his old number. Sir, what are you doing? It’s cold so I’m shutting the windows. Let’s go! Man. What are you doing? Get out of the way. This is not the place. Why are we running? He was trying to kidnap us. What? What are you on about? You were too busy eating to notice. Dad’s number! This? When did you get it? When you were all scared. Let’s call. Turn it off. Take out the battery! Take out the battery! Would my dad be like that guy? Why? Because he was scary? No, he seemed a bit sad. Adults are all like that, aren’t they? How would you feel if I got a boyfriend? If you get one, you get one. You don’t care? At all? Well, I think I’d be bored. Me too. Mom used to bring me here when I was younger. Oh yeah? That must’ve been nice. Not really. She looked sad. Didn’t smile much. Can’t you just ask her about your dad? No. Why not? I wonder how much she must hate him to say he was dead. Okay. I’m on my way. I’ll be home soon, Granny. Let’s go. She’s going crazy. Where are you going? There. Oh yeah! You ran away. You’re really not going home? Hi, Nok-yang. Hello. Were you with Bo-hee? Yes. He’s with the class president. Don’t worry about him too much. Okay, then. You are so mature. But Bo-hee still acts like a child. Ma’am. Yes? It’s nothing. Hold on. Bo-hee’s clothes. He must be wearing the same underwear for days. Don’t worry. Bye. Bye. Say hello to your gran and tell Bo-hee to text me back. This is good. Mom works, so I had to cook often since I was little. What does she do? A hair salon. Your hair is sorted for life then. Not sure if she has much talent though. Why? You look okay. This was done by a staff. How long have you dated Nam-hee? About three years. How did you two meet? Are you curious? I work at a bar on the weekends. Excuse me. Miss. We are closed now. And then? She came to the bar a few more times, and we hit it off. You’ve never dated, have you? I’m in middle school. But it’s okay to run away from home? You remind me of my friend. In what way? Your big appetite. Boys your age eat like a horse. Dad, are you seeing anyone? You’re the spitting image of your dad. Look at those lazy toes. What’s wrong with taking after dad? Your mom was such a hard worker. Too bad she got pregnant in college. What about me? Do I look like her? You? You take after your dad. Nam-hee. Baby. Don’t you want me? It’s not that. Then what’s wrong? We haven’t done it in a while. I’m a virgin. What? What are you talking about? I was a virgin before you. I just can’t, okay? Just this once, please? Just once. Shit. That stings. Tell me about the guy you’re living with. Is he a dirtbag? Him? No, he’s not like that. You said he has tattoos. He’s a bit rough but seems nice. He reminds me of you. I’ll kill you. He is a man! Gives me a similar feeling. By the way, what were you saying? Well, some lady picked up. Could you call back later? Where did he go without his phone again? Who are you? I’m so scatterbrained. I left my phone again? Sorry about that. Who are these students? You thought I was your father? Hold on. How old are you? - Fourteen. - Fourteen. Fourteen? That would mean I had kids when I was 50. But sadly, I divorced when I was 48. Why did you get divorced? Well, aren’t you plucky? I went home one day, and the missus asked me to sign the divorce papers. And? I asked her to wait a few days. But she couldn’t wait and just left. So I signed and faxed it to her. I’m sorry. For what? For making you talk about this. No, no. Do you know a LEE Soo-min? I’d remember a person with the same name as me. He was good at photography and art. There’s been many people like that. If I remember, I'll call. Give me your number. - Thank you. - Thank you. He seems very nice. Yeah but why did his wife want to get divorced? I wonder if I’ll find Dad. I don’t even know what he looks like. What kind of man would you like your father to be? I just hope he’s not a bad man. Manly, unlikely me. You’re plenty manly. Nok-yang, will you tell him to go home today? Bo-hee, I’m going to a funeral. Be back tomorrow. Come home and eat. Closed for two days due to personal reasons Put it in the fridge when you’re done – Mom Wolves are described as being lonely and used to describe the act of living alone, away from society. But they’re social animals that live in family units and show stronger family bonds than other mammals. Wolves are often compared to men with bad intentions, but in reality, they’re one of very few monogamous species... What’s the time? I’m late. How much money do I have? Man, no money. I’m sorry that you realized that your dad is alive because of me. But I wish you wouldn’t go searching for your dad. Why not? No good will come of finding out. Let’s say you find him. What if he has another son your age, or what if he is trash? Have you thought about this? What I mean is that the world is a tough place. Do you have both parents? I’m an orphan. Didn’t you know? I’m sorry. Nothing for you to be sorry about. Anyway, I’ll tell Nam-hee to find out about your dad. But I can’t contact her. She dropped her phone in the toilet or something. She’s so carefree. She is careless. What? You said she’s carefree when you meant she’s careless. Smartass. Where did you go on vacation this time? Jeju Island again. I’m sick of it. I went to New York again. - I wanna go somewhere new for once. - Snobs. I’m jealous. Forget them. They’re probably lying. Oh, right. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Want to see something fun? What’s this? Liquor that Mom made before I was born. Granny downed it yesterday. Nobody knows how hard I had it! Fine, let’s turn in. Is she okay? She’s fine. Why did you bring the bottle? To show off. Do you own the place? Huh? You can’t just get it on here. Go outside and do it. What’s your problem? I wasn’t talking to you. Mind your own business. This is ridiculous. Hey. Let’s go to the snack shop. It’s on me. No. Hey. Weakling twat. Take that back before I rip you a new one. Hey! How annoying! How can you be that annoying? I want to change my name. To what? I haven’t thought about it. Liar. Oh, I forgot. Want to go somewhere after school? Where? I was kidding when I said to come over. Who’s this, girlfriend? No, my best friend. The one that you remind me of. You’re saying I’m like a chick? Look in the mirror, loser. Who are you calling a chick? Wow, what a day! See? She’s just like you. Give me a beer. Beer? Can you even drink beer? This is the kind of stuff that I drink. Don’t drink too fast or you’ll pass out. Actually, I didn’t know cocktails taste so good. You’re a natural drinker it seems. Sorry I didn’t recognize. Well, now you know. If you two aren’t dating, why are you together all the time? We’re bosom buddies. We’re making a documentary. Bosom. What’s the documentary for? Does it have to be for something? We find him because we want to. We film it because we want to. Sung-wook? What’s your dream? My dream? I want to open a bar like this. Mine is... I want to be like Nok-yang. Look, she really is not very good. Not just saying it because I’m mad at her. I just need a cut. I warned you. You’re one good-looking bachelor. Thank you. Really, I just need a cut. No, no. Everyone gets a perm these days. Those actors on TV? It’s hardly noticeable, but they’ve all got it done. I’ll make you look beautiful. Okay. And how old are you? I’m 29. Don’t lie. I’m way too old to fall for that. I’m not lying. You want to see my ID? Let me see. Oh my goodness. I’m sorry. What’s wrong with your hair? Don’t laugh. I’m gonna get rid of it. I don’t think that’s possible. How did I end up with two kids? I’m sorry. Your mom needs to close her shop. This is just wrong. I told you she was bad. I was going to stop her in the middle, but I just couldn’t. Why? She started talking about you. And seemed like she had a bit to drink too. You work late. Nobody is waiting for me at home. You live alone? I have a son. I see. He is such a nice boy. But maybe he’s hit puberty. He’s been acting up lately. Where’s the husband? We split up when the boy was young. Divorce is common these days. My boy was too young to know anything, but he waited outside for his dad every day. Later he asked why he wasn’t coming. Without thinking, I just said he died in an accident. That was crazy. You don’t talk to your ex at all? I don’t know. He’s somewhere. I remembered. I had a student named LEE Soo-in. Here is his close friend’s number. Good luck. Bo-hee and Nok-yang? What do you want to know? Do you know my dad? We were close back in college. He used to show me what he wrote. Male lead’s name was always Bo-hee. Then he graduated and got a job. Didn’t think he’d marry. Why? We weren’t close when he divorced. I heard he quit work too. What was he like? From the moment I met him, I liked him. But I don’t think I knew what he was thinking. Thank you for your time. I’ll get going. Hey. Why are you looking for him? Just because. Do you have something to say to him? Would you be able to say it? At least we got his name. I’m not doing this anymore. Why? Don’t really want to see him. Liar. You want to see him. This is fun for you? What? How could you say that? You were curious about your dad too. My dad? He abandoned me. Biologically he is your father. Must be nice that everything is so simple for you. Don’t look for him then. - I didn’t force you to... - I’m scared. What if I find him, and he avoids me? You have a granny, dad, and aunts. Nobody ever left you. I know my mom’s face. But I have no memories of her. Because I never had a mom. But if you find him, you can see him or talk to him. I envied you so I wanted to find him together. You don’t have to do it. Bo-hee! Just got here now? Yes. Why the long face? Nothing. Come with me. Bath house - Two please. - Okay. Where are you going? Last time you came to a bath house was with your mom? Yes. Wow. Let’s get you cleaned up. Get undressed. I can’t. What is this kid on? Can’t you go in first? Fine. Toilet What are you doing? - Get in. - Come on! Get in. What the! Come on! It’s hot. Get out. Where to? The cold bath. It’s freezing! Oh that feels good. Know how to go underwater? Never tried. Try it. Let’s make a bet, banana milk. You can hold your nose. One, two, three. What was that? Too hot. Something bothering you? I had a fight with Nok-yang. I think it’s my fault. Why are you with her all the time? Don’t other kids tease you two? Well. Look, he has no pants on. He’s naked! Na-na na-na boo-boo. Stick your head in doo-doo. Get out of here! Who are you? His girlfriend? I said get out of here. Let’s go. I knew then. Know what? That she’d never leave me. Like I wanted to lean on her. Same here. Turn around. Ouch! - Don’t be a crybaby. - It hurts. Nok-yang, pack your bag and step out. Don’t talk. Keep studying. What happened? Nok-yang’s grandmother passed away. What’s the big deal about a granny dying? What did you say? Who cares if her granny died? Do you fancy Nok-yang? You crazy? Then why do you hate us? I don’t hate you. Two orphans hanging together sickens me... Are you crazy? Go on then. Hit me! Come on. Hit me. What are you doing? Mom, I’m home. I said I’m home. Mom. You don’t call. You don’t come home. I was worried sick, okay? What happened to your face? I fell. Look at you. Mom. Nok-yang’s grandmother passed away. Poor Nok-yang. Excuse me. Don’t I know you from somewhere? No, never seen you before. Really? You look so familiar. I better lend a hand. Stay and eat. That was close. What happened to your face? Did you get beat up? No. Liar, I can tell. Did you get beat up? No, I fought back. How many times did you hit him? How can I count that? Liar. What’s up with your face? Did you get beat up? No. Have you eaten? Hey. What? Say you’re terminally ill. Stop, I don’t like this. Just assume you are. Fine, why? And you will die tomorrow. Then wouldn’t you want to see your parents one last time? Nope. You will die tomorrow. Then I’d want to be with ones I love. I don’t even know my parents. The one you love is Nam-hee? Shut up, kid. The kid you hit lives here? And I have to apologize? Help yourself. I came to apologize for hitting you. I’m sorry for what happened, ma’am. I thought Seung-hyun had no friends because he’s so aloof all the time. Seems he’s all grown up, even getting into fights. You don’t have a dad, so you brought your brother? Even your brother looks poor. Seung-hyun. Father’s not around? It must’ve been tough for your mom. Your brother looks much older. In fact, I look after him like a son. You should’ve hit him more. Dad. Son. What happened to your face? It’s nothing. This is Seung-hyun’s classmate. They fought, and he came to apologize. Nice to meet you. Kids will be kids. Some tea? No thank you. We already had some. I’m sorry. You’re small but have the guts. Come over some time. Then get home safe. Have you ever waited for someone? Well, I grew up in an orphanage. Once in a while, rich people showed up to adopt kids. So, I waited to be adopted. Then it dawned on me. What did? That I can never be a kid they’d want. Why not? I don’t know. I just knew. So, I made up my mind to get out of there and survive on my own. And as soon as I made it out, Hey. Are you okay? Not a single taxi around. This won’t do. Come here. Are you crying? Oh man. Mom. You up? How do you feel? How long do I have to live? What? I’m sure longer than me. I’m not dying? But that really hurt. Yet, you didn’t tell me or go see a doctor? But you get mad when I tell you I’m feeling sick. No parent likes to see their child getting ill. You have a pneumothorax. You have to be careful to prevent recurrence. What’s that? You get it if you're too skinny. KIM Sung-wook! What happened? What? What? Auntie? You look well. I’m glad. Thanks to you. I don’t know where I’d be now, if you didn’t take me in when I ran away. Seems Bo-hee was looking for his dad. I didn’t want to tell him, but things turned out this way. Do you, by chance, have his number? I don’t know either. We haven’t spoken in a while. I think he blames himself for everything. Bo-hee. Look at the camera. On three. One, two, three. Remember that guy at the publishing house? Saying something about your name for a character? I searched movies and found one with a character named Bo-hee. Guess the director’s name. LEE Soo-in! This is crazy! I think it’s fate. Okay, you said that already. - He looked strangely familiar. - Hush. Bo-hee. Bo-hee. Let’s go. The movie is boring though. - It’s that geek again. - Director LEE. Thank you, Director LEE. That geek must be the director. What do we do? Should we go talk to him? Nok-yang. You remember when we first met? At the pool? One day when I was a kid, Dad stopped coming home. I waited for him every day at the playground. But after a few days, I knew he won’t be coming back. I was crying by myself when you came and talked to me. I never waited for Dad after that. Because I was always with you. Well, that’s true. I’ll go alone to see him, for the last time. I’ll never look for him again. Because I have you. Also, I have Mom, and I have Sung-wook. I will call you. Hello, I’m Bo-hee. Dad, it’s me Bo-hee. Wow, this is big. - Look here! - Come on. So ugly. I thought I made you leave. - Mom. - Yes? Do you still see that guy? No. Why? Because you don’t like him. I don’t dislike him. I don’t even know him. Okay. Mom. What? I won’t change my name. Why? You always wanted to. I think it’s okay. It’s different. Hi. It’s been a while. Hey. Your birthday is today? Happy birthday. Present? It’s his birthday. What’s with you? It’s my birthday too. Same birthday? I give up. I got you this. Stop being immature. - Hey kids, set the table. - Yep. - It’s our thing. - Shut up. - You have no clue. - Shut up. You scared me. Wash your hands. You scared me. You really scared me. - She didn’t wash either. - It’s okay. Is it good? - Is it good? - Salty. Hi, I can’t buy a gift so hope you enjoy it. Happy birthday. Pipe down you lot. Hi, your name was so funny at first... Bo-hee? Who’s that? Hey, LEE Bo-ji! Like a girl’s name. He is okay looking but A good cook. Remember what I said that day... So, your mother lied to you? I think so. Gran, you know my friend. I used to pick on you so much. I am very sorry. While looking for your dad, I’m glad you found me. I hope you don’t get your feelings hurt. Bo-hee. You know I can’t live without you. Strange kid. Stop wasting time and study. Maybe, just maybe. What is it? I think my dad could be alive. Hello, my name is LEE Bo-hee. Can’t you get it right? Put it away. I’m not doing it. Let’s go. Let’s eat. Okay. It was moving, right?
