A BETTER WAY TO DIE (2000) - FULL TRANSCRIPT

foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- - Is he nervous? - Yeah, he might be a little nervous. Big fucking nervous if you ask me. Nobody's nervous. If these fucks smell any nerves on you, they'll know you're a cop. And if they know you're a cop, if they even think you're a cop, - - they'll slit your fucking throat and drop you in this alley. Permanently. That dumpster will be your new condo. Why don't you go screw yourself, Fletcher? It's "fuck yourself"! Why don't you go fuck yourself? Lose the dress, will you, honey? Christ. - Mary Poppins here's too nervous. - Nobody's nervous. Lunchtime. Time for lunch. - What is up with this lunchtime shit? - Meals are very important to him. Then why did he toss the last three all over the alley? After this, we shoot over to Mona & Jerry's. - A little pasta and meat sauce. - I like meat sauce. I know. You guys are sweet. You're tight. Hey, college boy. Don't fuck this up, or you'll get us all killed. Hey, Carlos? - I'm nervous. - I know. - You good? - Good enough. If they start asking ten thousand questions, what do you say? If you guys are going to make us take some SATtest... Pick it up. You have to come back at them with brass ball. What are you doing? Selling spaghetti? Put your hands down. If you don't know what to do with your hands, just scratch your balls. Nobody will ever look at you and say: "That guy looks nervous." Maybe: "He's a slob." "He's got no class," but never: "That guy looks nervous." Again. Don't always look right at the man. Look around. Watch the cars go by. Or watch some dog taking a shit across the street. You only look the man in the eye when you're insulting him. Again. This time give me some profanity. If you jackasses are going to make us take the goddamn SATs... ...before we do business. That's good. More profanity. Shit. Fuck. Motherfucker. They'll eat that shit up. Don't forget "cocksucker". It's timeless. Never loses its punch. Cocksucker. If you fuckfaces are going to make us stand in the freezing fucking cold - - and take the goddamn SATs before we do business, - - you can take your shit merchandise and stick it up your ass. I suggest you virgins take your jerk jobs at a tortilla stand - - and get on back to Shamburg or Arlington fucking Heights. Or whatever candy-assed suburb you bitches took the bus out of. We're doing you the motherfucking favour! Remember that. Cocksucker. Gee, what a mouth on this guy. You kiss your mother with that mouth? We thought Rico worked out all the bullshit with you pap smears. Yeah, me and Rico did a little talking today. - What did he say? - He said you guys are really tight. - What else did he say? - He said you guys are tight and... What was that other thing he said? Go get Rico. We're going to get Rico. Oh yeah, that's right. He said you guys are cops. - You hurt him, you die. - I want you to see something. See that? That's what we do to pigs! Even little piglets like you. Damn it! You motherfucker! Shit... Come on, you fucking goons! Boomer... go get that motherfucker! Fuck! You have the right to remain silent. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Do it, Boomer. I'm your witness. He went for his gun. For Carlos, man! For Carlos. Get with the programme, kid. Or get the hell out. Big Daddy's Diaper Service. You mess 'em, we press 'em. - How's my old partner? - Harrison James. Rifkin, I'm in a jam and you might be the only guy I can trust. Fuck you. I've completed the file and I'm turning it over to my bureau contact. But it may be a double-cross, Rifkin, and I may need your help. Fuck you. Salvy, it's me, Harry. I'm in a serious mess, Salvy. Pick up. Please. Go wait for me. There's a good chance I'm walking into a set-up. If you don't hear from me by tomorrow, - - call Flash. He'll find me. You said you'd forgive me when I was ready. I'm ready. Looks like it's just you and me, pal. I want to see him first. Face to face. I want to see him. Pick up, Rifkin. I'm going to Canyon. It's nine thirty. You look like hell. Nice work. Coop, this is... Asshole! Cheryl... Sharon? It was Cheryl. I think that was Cheryl. The director's in town. He wants to see you. - He's here? In Chicago? - And he wants to see you. Steer you breath away from his direction. You still have that Bouquet de Bourbon je ne sais quoi. Nervous? Wait a second. Let me get this thing off. Fuck it. Billy, what do you know about special agent Harrison James? He was supposed to deliver some information to us - - which we were then to relay to Washington, but he never showed. Special agent James has been with the CIB over twelve years. He has been extremely loyal and extremely effective. All contact with him has been through telecommunications. His identity has been classified due to the nature of his assignment. And the nature is? Are you familiar with the name Charles Van Adder. Yes. Supposedly the head of an internal spy ring. A domestic organization, I believe. We believe he is gathering classified government information - - and selling it to the highest bidders. Special agent Dexter... I am quite aware that you are responsible for shutting down - - two of the biggest crime families in this city. Thank you for being so... aware, sir. Even more impressive is you did so at such a young age. However, much less inspiring are your achievements since your promotion. You spend more time womanizing than giving a shit about national security. - Some would call you a drunk. - We need you back one hundred per cent. We need someone who knows the mob. We're afraid Van Adder has united the families your team shut down, - - and nowthey're working against the government. Special agent James has compiled information on one of these. Identities of Van Adder informants, which would allow us to shut him down. Practically overnight. Why me? Why here in Chicago? Special agent James was going to deliver the file to us here in Chicago. - But he didn't. - Why not? We don't know. - Do we think he's been killed? - We don't know. The bureau does not like not knowing things. Dead or alive, James is in the area and Van Adder is on to him. Find special agent James and his file before Van Adder does. You find him before the bureau does. His woman has hired a detective. He goes by the name Flash. See what he knows. Any problems... deal with them. Goodbye, Carlos. I can't make it here without Carlos. I need you, Kelly. I miss you. I miss you. But I don't like what you do, Boomer. I don't like that city and I'm never going back there. I'm leaving Chicago, Kell. I want to come up there and be with you. I want to make it work this time. - I want to make it work - What are you saying? I quit the department. I'm done. For good. Boomer, are you coming up here because you hate that city? - Or because you love me? - I love you, Kelly. And I'll prove it to you if you give me one more chance. Just listen to me. Take care of everything you have to take care of down there. And then get up here as fast as you can. Beautiful night for baseball in Chicago. One away, bottom half of the fifth. One-one tie at this point. Hubert tossing a dandy for Toronto. Hello? Please stop! Hubert set. Inside and tie ball one. He came after him a bit on that one. Really setting the tone for this at bat. - What seems to be the problem? - And it's long! This ball is way back! And it's out of here! - Is this an ambush? - What? Roll over. On your belly. Let's go. - It's the "hurt guy on the road" trick. - No, sir. Just a hurt guy on the road. I invented that trick, son. If anybody tries to ambush me, - - your partner here gets it between the eyes - - and up the kester! There's no ambush. It's just me. - No ambush? - No, sir. Well, shit. - They call me Flash. - They call you Flash? - Well, they call me Boomer. - They call you Boomer? Boomer. Flash. I like my nickname better. - Did you come up from the city, Boomer? - Yes, Flash. And I'm never going back. - Are you the nervous type? - Nobody's nervous. Jesus, fuck! - Breakfast time. Time for breakfast. - Yes, it is. I've got cheddar cheese and crackers. Danishes, doughnuts, croissants. Beef jerky, turkey jerky, bologna. Tuna in springwater or olive oil. - You like protein shakes? - Yes. Meals in themselves. I've got Swiss vanilla, chocolate fudge. Banana-strawberry and my favourite orange-pineapple. - I'll try a chocolate fudge today. - Fantastic! Who's your daddy? What's with the piece? My line of work requires it from time to time. "Flash. Finder of lost shit." Say you lost your granddaddy's watch your daddy gave you five years ago. I can find her for you. Or you're looking for some fancy Chinese pottery you lost in Guatemala. - I'll find that too. I find lost shit. - No shit? - No, lost shit. - You hunting for something right now? - Affirmative. - What? That's classified, soldier. - What did those bastards take from you? - What didn't they take from me? They got my car, all my bags, my money. - Nothing that matters. - Holy cow. Let me see that. Oh my. You've got yourself an agenda. A long-term agenda. - Lucky lady know it's coming? - It'll come at her like a curve ball. - Think she'll take a swing at it? - I wish I knew. What the fuck are you doing? I see it. Watch the road, man. Worry not, Boomer boy. She'll swing for the fences and then some. - Home run? - Out of the park, happy ending. You've got good energy, boy. Things are going to go your way. Don't worry. I'm going to stake you to a bus ticket. - We've got to get you to this girl. - You're all right, Flash. Hey, Flash, is there any special reason you're driving... ...400 miles an hour? Affirmative. It's recently come to my attention - - a carload of fellers has been trailing me. Fellers. Professionals. Assassins. - It's hard to tell. - Assassins? You know what? You can just let me out up here. Look, drop me off. Pull over. No stopping until the next town. You wait until the next town, or you can jump out right now. Give me the phone. - Where? What? - Press the green button. Green button. Hello? Flash? He's got his hand full at the moment. You've got the wrong guy, lady. My name isn't Harry. - Just put the speakerphone... - One second. Put it down there. Just put it back in the cylinder. No, English, sweetheart. Whoever answered sounds like Harry. I thought maybe you found him. - Not yet, Mrs Jellybellvetus. - Gelefaveta. Where are you? Right now I'm hauling ass, heading north going up to Middletown. Did you check that number in Chicago? Yes. Some jerk named Rifkin kept hanging up on me. If you think my co-pilot sounds like Harry, - - maybe we ought to get him to give Mr Rifkin a call. Nowthat's an ambush. Who's number one? That has got to hurt. You knowthe best way to make that pain go away from your head? You re-diffuse the pain. I'll bet you forgot all about that little pain in your head. - What do you know about Harrison James? - I don't know jack. No one's asking about Jack. What do you know about Harry? Now what do you know? What the fuck are you doing? Mr Van Adder likes them to sweat it out a bit. I work for him and you work for me. Hence, by transit of fucking property, you do what the fuck he says. Shit isn't professional, man. That's the shit that's floating in your bowl, so live with it, Cleveland. Why don't you and your cousin do what I'm paying you to do? Cleveland, why don't we tell this guy to fuck off? We can go back down south tonight. Lou... I would love to get laid tonight by my wife in my bed. But we need this job. We need the dough. Zoe and Cassandra need the dough. Carpe per diem. - Seize the cash. - Fuck that. We're not going to fuck that! You hear me? Until one of us wins the fucking lotto, we'll deal with these white fucks. Shoot this piece of shit. I'm jammed. Fuck that! I don't have time to shoot everybody, - - just because this white douche bag says we should. It'll fuck up my karma. You waste him. Merry fucking Christmas, asshole. We do this job, we get the cash. We head back down south. Together. Peace, brother. Peace. - Do I know you? - Do I know you? You know something about this? You know something about who killed Flash? Yeah. It wasn't me. - You're the one with the voice, right? - What are you talking about? Who the fuck are you? Why are you driving this truck? I traded it for my Volvo. It's faster. - Stop the truck. I want out. - Sorry, no can do. - No slowing down. - I'm serious. I want out. You can wait until the next town or jump out now. But I'm not slowing down. I was just saying that I'm in trouble and I needed some help. And I was ready to offer to untie you, - - treat you to a nice dinner and buy you a bus ticket to anywhere you want to go. If you would be willing to make one simple phone call for me. I'll throw in 300 bucks. - Give me the number. - Okay, here it is. If he buys you as Harry, ask him where he thinks you are. Where I am? - Where Harry is. You have to be smart. - I'll be clever. Big Daddy's Diaper Service. You mess 'em, we press 'em. How are you doing there? I need to speak with Rifkin. - Harry James, you sockcucker. - That's right. It's me, Harry. Still alive. You didn't sound too good on those messages. I was hoping you were dead. Harry James is on the line with Yanosh Rifkin. - Now? - Yeah, we have an exact location. - If we had that line monitored... - Then Van Adder did too. We need to get together. Set up a meeting. I like meetings. I can't tell you exactly where I am because we might have eavesdroppers. Get to Chicago by Sunday. Esquire Lounge. Tarbender will tell you what to do. - He's gone. - What happened? You got yourself a date in Chicago on Sunday at the Esquire Lounge. - Good. But you must come with me. - I'll meet you down there. - Goodbye and good luck. - No, you're coming with me. - How are you doing, Harry? - Who are you? I'm the president of the Middletown welcoming committee. - And that's the vice-president. - Fantastic. Welcome to Middletown, dickhead. One simple, easy phone call? The word was you were tough, Harry. I'll break you in two so fast. I'm not Harry James. Would you tell him this? He's not Harry James. He's not even half the man Harry is. He's a nobody. A loser. They get your point. Tell the boys we've got him up at Novelli's hardware. Go get the truck now! That's Harry James? Do not kill him! Goddamn, Lou. Baby, get up. Don't kill him. Stop! I said, don't kill him. Nice job. Just chill out. - We need the file. - Fuck the file. That's sweet Lou laying dead back there. Contact every Van Adder affiliate and give them a full description of him. If we don't have him by morning, you'll be in a lot of pain, understand? Sure, no problem. That's nice. Do they make those for men? You want your clock stopped, boy? Or do you just want it cleaned? He should have been dead yesterday. I didn't know he was Harrison James. Besides, today you said, don't kill him. Just one time, surprise me and do what I say. I'm going to kill that boy. As God is my judge, - - I'm going to take him down. Stop the truck. - Why? - Stop the truck. - I'm getting out. I've had enough. - No, you're not. Oh yes, I am. See you. You can't do that. Get out of my face. Please help me find Harry. I'll pay you. - You already paid me. - I'll pay you again. Look, Miss Yelisavey... - I'll call you Salvy. Hows that? - That's what Harry used to call me. Really? That's very touching. Why do you need to find Harry so badly? He sounds like a real pain in the ass. - Why don't you dump the bastard? - I already did. I divorced him. What, now you want him back? No. He was in trouble and he turned to me. Now I have to find him, but I'm alone and this may be a bit over my head. I'll say. You know, I made a phone call. One simple, easy phone call. Five minutes later I've got blood all over my nice new shirt. Shoot that through the wash. Give it to Harry when you find the bastard. We are not hauling that thing with us. He's got a wife waiting for him down south. That's where I'll bury him. Yeah, but he's going to stink up my van. Don't you fuck with me. Not now. Your car died? No, don't take a bus. Don't hitch-hike. Just sit tight. I can be there by morning. Just sit back, relax, have a beer. You got it. I'm in room number five. - Sweet dreams. - Bye-bye. Hey, baby. Are you going to stand here all night and sniff that flower? - Or come and say hi? - Hi, sleepyhead. - Long drive? - Yeah, but well worth it. You made good time, girl. What did you average? 300 miles an hour? - 400. - That's pretty fast. - Good-Iooking guy. - Mr Yanosh Rifkin. Aka the sexiest man in the Chicago underworld. This is James' former partner. We can monitor Rifkin's line and pinpoint anyone who contacts him. The problem is Rifkin's a telecommunications expert. We don't know where the hell he is as he is a telecommunications expert. The best there is. Can we do a little something about ...? So, was special agent James still working with Cary Grant here? No chance. James reported Rifkin for dealing drugs and weapons to the Chicago underworld, - - which is now where he hides somewhere. B plus, Coop. And we knowthey've planned a Chicago rendezvous for next Sunday. A minus. I wish I could wake up every morning like this. You will. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Is that right? - That's right. - Is that so? - That's so. Big day. Get up. I don't want to. Not yet. Big day. I want to hit the road. - I'll drive until St Albans. - St Albans? - What happens in St Albans? - I'll tell you. They've got this little vineyard about 20 miles north of here. They've got a little caf?. They have little picnics down by the pond. - Ducks shooting around left and right. - You like ducks, huh? I talked to the guy at the front desk. He said they do some good chow. We'll have a nice lunch. So nice we're going to call it brunch. - Brunch, huh? - That's right. With a nice bottle of wine. - What's the occasion? - Big surprise. What? I can't tell you what, or it won't be a surprise, dummy. - Coffee might get me out of bed. - Then I will go snag you some coffee. Then we'll hit the road. - Why are you wearing my shirt? - I like this flower-power action. It takes the edge off my overbearing masculinity. - Where's your shirt? - I don't know. Here it is. Why is there blood all over your shirt, Boomer? Yeah, why is there blood on your shirt? I told you, I bumped my head. Boomer, I don't like it when you lie to me. Especially when it involves bloody T-shirts. How did you get the cut on your head, Boomer? What happened to your car? Don't tell me you'll leave all that shit when you've only hauled it with you! - Nobody's taking anything with them. - You're going to end up the dead one. - You'll end up like Carlos. - Nobody will end up like Carlos. - I'm sick of this shit! - I'm sick of it too. - Bullshit, Boomer! - Nobody's bullshitting you! - What did you bump your head on? - I bumped it on a guy. A guy? You know, a headbutt. Look, Kell. Some other things happened over the last day - - that had nothing to do with me being a cop. Nothing. You remember when you sent this to me? Two years ago. And every day for two years I've carried this with me in my pocket. Every day during that awful job in that awful city. This is what I want, Kell. But I don't want any of it if I'm not with you. I love you, Kell. And I'll do anything for you. - Anything? - Anything. Take me to brunch. And take that off, okay? Why don't you get dressed and ready, and I'll go snag you that cup of coffee. And then we'll go to brunch. That's right. Ten minutes is all I can give you, boss. - How are we doing this morning? - I hate this fucking job. Surprise, surprise, motherfucker! Fuck! Fuck. What the fuck ...? What the fuck are you looking at? Listen to me. My name isn't Harry, and I'm not who you're looking for. You're exactly who I'm looking for, motherfucker. You're a dead man. Oh yeah? Go ahead, motherfucker. Make my day. You can't stop me, motherfucker! Merry fucking Christmas, asshole. We're even. Don't move, bastard. Come on! Bathroom's clear. Looks like we've got a manhunt. Hold your fire! Get the hell off my property! - I said, get the fuck off my property. - Put the gun down now! - Get out! - Set it down now or we're both dead! - Get out! - Don't fire! So long, Harry Jim. You satisfied? That guy had a chance to kill me and he didn't. You killed his girl, didn't you? Why? Why not? What goes around comes around. I knowthat for a fact. On many occasions I've been the cat to make the shit come around. - What's the word, Coop? - It wasn't Harrison James. The report says that the dental work belongs to a 45-year-old tobacco chewer. Deputy Warner, did you actually... Sheriff Warner, did you see agent James? First of all, who did we torch? You brain surgeons can figure that out. Where is special agent James now? If he's still in Kurker County, we'll find him. Do me a favour, would you, Reg? This time try not to light him on fire. I currently have two unidentified bodies at the food mart. A dead sheriff and a young lady. And your man is responsible. - We're talking about a federal agent. - I don't care if he's an astronaut. Come shit or Shinola, if we find him, we just might torch the bastard again. Can we talk somewhere? Don't you ever give me one of your Captain Kangaroo speeches again. Don't get righteous because you have two dead bodies in your backyard. Some civilians got killed, yes. That's the little picture. The big picture is called national fucking security. - Can you say that? - National fucking security. That's right. Look, if special agent James is in this area, we must find him. Says here there was quite a shoot-'em-up over in Pine Cove. Says a sheriff was killed. Also says here a pretty young lady got shot up pretty badly. Six, seven times. You know anything about that? You had something to do with this? I'm innocent. Well, it isn't my job to judge you. But you've got to clear out of here tomorrow morning first thing. Deputy Ray Warner, please. It was in your pants pocket. I know. Now, you've got some bread, you've got some clean clothes. Would you like to take this along for guidance? I'll feel better if you take this along. For guidance. - Go! Go! - Bedroom's clear. - Clear out here too. - Shit. Okay, bring her here. Make double sure you've got no shadows. Nobody shadows Tex. All right, looks like me and you are going for a little ride, sweet tits. Who the fuck are you? I said, who the fuck are you? I'm Harry James. That's him, right there. Harry Jim. Is it really you, Harry? I'm afraid so. Bullshit. I don't know who you are, man, but you're not Harry Jim. Us blind fothermuckers have bullshit radar built in. - I need some information from you. - You do? You give me one reason why I shouldn't blow your head off. Sockcucker. - Tex, please tell me you frisked him. - I took a gun off him. Now you give me one good reason why I shouldn't blow your head off. Cocksucker. Whatever you're reaching for had better be a sandwich. Because you're going to eat it. What do you know about Harry Jim, you little fat fuck? - He left messages. I have the tapes. - Then play them. Rifkin, pick up. Rifkin... I'm bad, man. They got me bad. I'm going to... Canyon. The old rendezvous. I've got it on me. What the fuck? Look way south... Then go west, past Joliette. See it? Yeah, I see it. Why haven't you sent someone out there? I don't give a shit anymore. We've got company. Bring it on, sockcuckers. CIB, the building's surrounded. We're not here to fight. - We're here to help. - Fuck you. Killing a sheriff is a serious crime. I could turn it into a parking ticket. I need to know what you learned from Rifkin. I need to find special agent James, and I need your help. I really don't feel like helping anybody right now. I know what happened up in Pine Cove. I know what happened to your friend in that hotel room. I'm sorry, kid. Really, I am. I've had two wives. I lost them both because of this job. One left me, the other one was taken away. When this is all over, we can play Spanish violins for each other, - - but until then, why don't you do something about it? I'm betting Van Adder's following me right now. I'll help you find Harry, - - but if you and your boys tag along, he's never going to show his face. But if you stay back in the shadows, - - he just might move in for the kill, letting us snag Harry, the file - - and Van Adder. I'm sorry for what I said about Harry. Calling him a bastard. Don't worry, he was. He was a bastard. Any other man could go to hell, but he's the father of my son. For that, he gets a second chance. If he's still alive. Life's a bitch, isn't it? - Look who's not dead yet. - I'd kill him right now. Before you kill anyone, you should know you're surrounded by federal agents. Yeah, right. Yes? Just what I wanted to hear. I'm sorry. - Laslov, did you find the file? - The case is right there. Miles? Where is the file? - We haven't touched a thing. - Make sure it's not on him. - Great. - Maybe it wasn't in the case. No, Laslov! He had it in his case when he met me at the rock quarry. What did you do with it? You were in here long enough to do something with it. Where is it? - It's nowhere on him. - Start talking. Get this thing out of here. What do you know, Boomer? What did you do with the file? Just start talking, please. I didn't touch anything. Now you can keep screaming or start talking. The choice is yours. Regular or unleaded? It'll make this nice and tender. I'm a great chef, did I tell you that? I love to barbecue. The man doesn't have a goddamn thing! Look, Mr Dexter or Van Adder. If this kid had your file, he would have coughed it up already. It's just some sorry cat we got mixed up with that dead motherfucker. If you torture him any more, - - it isn't professional. It's psychotic. So please... I should never have hired that homo. Who was that? Extra gun I hired. His name is Cleveland. Was Cleveland. It's been a real circus ride, huh, kid? Speaking of fun rides, your little girl was a wild tiger. But I turned her into a little pussycat. Boomer! Shit! Everybody out! I've never been much of a computer guy, - - but I have something you need. Give me back the file and you and her will be just fine. Just tell me where and when. Surprise, surprise, motherfucker. You weren't planning on taking my ride, were you? Because sweet Lou and me... ...we're taking this truck. - When's it all going to end? - When you all smell as bad as Lou. - Put your gun down. - You first. - "Can't we all just get along?" - I'm afraid not. In that truck I could make it to the southern border by sunset tomorrow. That's with a pit stop at a fucking hospital. Too bad I'm taking this truck. Save your ass, man. Run. Forget the girl. - Forget Vanada. - I won't forget a goddamn thing. I never touched your girl. That was wrong. Yeah, that was wrong. So was what happened to my cousin. That was wrong. Your cousin was trying to kill me. He wasn't lying half-naked in a hotel room sleeping. What the fuck is that? It's peace, brother. Peace. How about forgive and try to forget? And share the fucking truck. You're going to get yourself waxed trying to kill Van Adder. Okay. Take this. What, are you nervous? Nobody's nervous. You brought the file? Okay? Let's have it. There's your file, asshole. Now are you ready to die? Am I ready to die? I could raise my hand right now, snap my fingers, and you'd drop dead. Dead as if by the power of God. That's how much power I have. Who's number one? I'm not at the top of this. This is much bigger than you can understand. You kill me, you bought your death ticket. Wherever you go, - - wherever you are, - - you'll be on the run forever. Is that really how you want to live? I can't think of a better way. What the hell are you doing?
