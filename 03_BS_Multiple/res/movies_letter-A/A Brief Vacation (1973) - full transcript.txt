A BRIEF VACATION (1973) - FULL TRANSCRIPT

foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Take your seats, please. I saw a man I know. Which one is he? He's on the other side. With the mustache? No, the one waving. Quiet, please. I'm thinking of Ciro. I thought your name was Giulio, not Luigi. Well, I remember yours perfectly well, Clara. But I didn't forget our meeting, and for good reason. One day I'll tell you why. - Tell me now. - Some other time. Shall we go have some punch? I remember the punch too. But I'm with my friends. They can come too. It's almost dinnertime. We have to get back. Me too, but so what if we're late once? - He's younger than her. - Good! I like mature men. - May I see you again? - I don't know. You're a handsome couple. It's a pleasure to look at you. You'll wind up sleeping together. Clara, get in. - Good night. - See you soon. Nice smile! - What's he do? - He's a machinist. Looks too classy for a laborer. I'd say he's a lawyer. - I'd like to go with a worker someday. - Another crush! Yes, I do go through them quickly. It's fun to change. Yes, but there are limits. A woman shouldn't have more than 1 0 men in her life. Don't let it get all moldy between your legs, girls. On this trip around the world... I'd like to even have... an Eskimo. Hey, watch it! What are you doing, Scanziani? Are you crazy? Scared? Even the Grim Reaper doesn't scare me! If I saw him, know what I'd give him, with all due respect? The raspberry! I don't give a damn! Change the channel, for God's sake! I have a right to watch what I want. Your party and ours share a common goal.: putting an end to fascism. The majority wants to hear the singing. The minority has rights too. - Buy yourself a TV. - I don't have the money! That's your problem. We each create our own destiny. Ladies... Scanziani shot herself!. Where is she? They took her to the hospital in Sondrio. You can only stay five minutes. - I was hoping you'd come. - Don't talk too much. She's quite a chatterbox. Everyone sends you greetings. Everyone. They all wanted to come... but we could only get permission for one person. What did they say at the sanatorium? That I'm crazy? No, nobody said that. Everyone likes you very much. Give me your hand. Was it in the newspapers? Yes. What did they say? Your name. First and last. I bet they got it wrong. What else? They don't understand how it happened. It might've happened to anyone. The bastards! They write how things look, never how they are. Hush. Don't talk. You talk, then. You really are a Calabrian. It's like pulling teeth to get a word out of you. You all have an inferiority complex. Know what that is? What is it? I know what it is... but it's hard to say. I can't. Remember... If you don't speak up... they'll screw you over. Here's what I leave you in my will: ''If you act like a sheep, the wolf will eat you.'' You're right. You know life. Don't be so formal. It's laughable in my situation. Should I call someone? No. Sit down. It hardly hurts. I just made a tiny hole. What a dope! I couldn't even find my heart. And it's hard to miss! Feel how it beats? I sure do. You ever meet that guy again? No. Come along now. Wait. I'll tell you what you see. After the shot, I fainted, but first I saw lots of things. Like being on stage. Faces swam out of the darkened audience: an uncle, my grandmother... someone I glimpsed on the bus once. A hell of a thing! Forgive me, Sister. I saw my mother, the tower in my village, and a plate of lasagna! That's enough. Mother Superior will yell at me. Let's go. We'll all come tomorrow. It was wild, in a moment,just like that. Lasagna, still smoking hot. Like the bomb smoke in Tradate when I was seven. The sons of bitches! I'm sorry, Sister... but the world isn't much better today, is it? It couldn't be worse. You have good color. You're fine. Give me a kiss. It's true. I'm fine. I could even sing! What is this, a theater? I told you, no visitors. Give them an inch and they take a mile. I'm sorry. When may I come back? To make more ruckus? Forgive me. See you, Scanziani. Forgive what? Is this a prison? If I want to sing, I'll sing! Call the doctor. We're giving you an injection. You're not sticking a hole in my ass! I only have a few months, I know. At first I wanted to die because I was afraid of death. But I'm calm now. I've had thousands of shots, but I haven't gotten any better. I'm not letting them put any more holes in my ass! Watch your language, my child. Words are neither dirty nor clean. It depends. God hears every word you say. Good! Did I ask him to be born? Why did he invent TB? I had a career ahead of me! It's because he likes making people suffer. He'll probably drag this pain out for another year. An injection. You're blaspheming! I have a right to get revenge, to say what I want. Cover your ears! Before I die, I want to do everything. I want to say ''prick'' now, and I'll say it. Prick! And other words too! Teresa, I'll stay here with you. Don't cry. If you stay calm, you'll get well quicker. It's over. It's all over. We all turn into extroverts here, emotions spilling out all over. One person laughs too much, while another cries. Come on, stop thinking about it. Come and eat. How's Scanziani? She asked to be taken back to her town yesterday. She wants to die there. Signor Ciro is here. Oh, God, he found me! I don't want to see him. Tell him I'm not here! Clara, help me. Come with me. Give me courage, please. Come. Please. What can I do? No, I'm not going. Please. I beg you! Can you tell I'm sick? But he doesn't even know me. Please. This is a friend of mine. I came here for her. To be with her, to help her. That's a lie. You just came to humiliate me. What do you want? I spent a fortune on detectives to trace you. It's all over between us. I'm leaving you. I've decided. Clara is my witness. It's true, isn't it? Pack your bags. There's a doctor in Davoe who's cured even kings. My dear, it's merely a question of money. It would take too long here. Dearest. My love. You're my god! I love you. Here are madam's clinical records. Stop by the office. He kissed me on the mouth! He loves me. Did you see how much he loves me? Put this in the bag. Then close that one. I'll visit you in Milan. Write down your address. I'll leave you this coat... this sweater... this skirt... and this hat. It looks divine on you. Gina, I'll never wear these things. I wouldn't know how. You'll see. You'll be very chic. I'll leave all these for you. But make sure you use them. They're beauty products. Careful, this is very fragile. This too. These furs go in the car, with this suitcase. Good-bye, Clara. Best of luck. I'll visit you in Milan, I swear. Thank you, Doctor. Excuse me. That's all mine. I'll be back for it later. Strike! Strike! Hunger strike! Our illness is society's fault! We want full salary while we're sick! Listen, comrades... are you with us in this fight? The Cuneo Sanatorium is leading it. Viva Cuneo! Let's send a telegram! - How are you? - You frightened me. Strike to the bitter end, or they'll think we're just skipping a meal! There are 1 0,000 of us in Italy. This time we'll win. Don't let the director sway you. You have a bourgeois attitude toward women. We'll stick it out longer than you. You'll see. You know, I joined the strikers just to see you. What about your sign? I'm not very political. Are you? There's a great need. Although our factory... gives full salary for six months. But being here and thinking it over... I've realized factory life is unjust. You get used to it. Maybe you do. The minister must give his answer within 48 hours! Otherwise we'll strike again. - That's my window up there. - Which one? Behind the tree, on the top floor. And yours? The third, on the fourth floor. Then you can come to mine. I have an idea. Each night at 9:00, I'll turn out the light and turn it on again. On and off, several times. You have to look at 9:00. You like wasting your time, eh? Want me to forget about you, then? What a tragedy. Everyone's left. I'll wait for you every Wednesday in the town square. Even if you don't come, I'll be waiting. I have yesterday's x-rays in my office. I must explain them. Come along. You see, it's not going badly. It's healed, but not entirely. A slight strain could cause a relapse. Let's weigh you. I promised to send you home at month's end, but do you mind? No, this is like a vacation for me. Everyone is so good to me. You've put on two pounds, but you should try to break 1 30. And you will, if you don't worry about anything. What are you up to? Getting mixed up in politics? Edvige got me involved. The youngest patient, and the most fanatical. She's a good girl. If she were healthy, heaven knows how far she could go. And what do you think of me? You're like... a member of the family. Ouch! You destroyed me. Murdered me. I mean it. I know you mean it. That's the problem. I can't kiss you. Give me a kiss. What a nice surprise. Whose car is that? Mine and your husband's. A bargain. We decided to break it in by driving up here. - Did you learn to drive? - No, he drove. You should learn. It could be useful. Your leg's cured. You're walking well. You look cured, too. But you've changed. They give out clothes here, too? A girlfriend gave me her extras. I didn't recognize you. The child did. You look like a lady! Where's the sanatorium? Over there. It looks like a castle! Can you take the child? It's against the rules. I shouldn't even kiss him. It's dangerous. Maybe later, then. Where can we eat? There's a restaurant over there. I'll park the car. You go on ahead. Eat. Stop drinking. You have to drive. I'll sleep for a while later. You can use the car sometimes to go to work. Then you can give us a hand with the payments. - I can't drive. - I'll teach you. I might have to change factories. Otherwise I risk getting worse. Thank God you have that job! She's sick now. I'm getting injections for my liver. She's worn out, but she never complains. We have lots of troubles... and the longer you're away, the worse they get. You collect my whole salary. I don't even have a single lira. What for? You have everything you need here. Can't I do anything for myself? Like get this tooth fixed? Why? Forget it. Look at me. I'm missing half my teeth! You staying up here much longer? Until I'm really well. You're well now. It shows. You exaggerate, like when you write. The doctor has to say when I can leave. My son wants his wife beside him. He's not the type that fools around. You think I was lying when I wrote I'm still sick! We can all fit in the car. Come back with us. I'll hold the child on my lap. Don't think for a second that I'm going back with you! If I feel like it, I'll kick your ass back to Milan! I'm not your slave. I've learned a few things up here. You'll need the police to take me back to Milan! I'm not leaving here until the doctor says so. Sit down. A bottle of wine. Who reads these books? - I do. - You've learned to read? I knew how, but I'd forgotten. Here I've realized I'm not so stupid. So when you come home, you're going to play the lady? What lady? I just want to find a job that isn't so exhausting. What's the little one doing? He's asleep in the car. They could have let him in. It's against the rules. A sanatorium is a sanatorium. Let's go before it gets dark. - Clara. - Yeah. Come here. - What is it? - Shut the door. - Your mother wants to go. - Shut the door. If I hadn't called you in here, we wouldn't have had a word together. We always fight when we talk. We've never been apart for such a long time. You're right. Never. You might not believe it, but I never cheated on you. I didn't cheat on you either. No, Franco. Not like this. Let me go. The baby's down there alone. - Hey, come on, you two. -Just a moment. He could come in. I have to get gas. You're tryin' to get rid of us. You got your mind on somethin' else. Like what? I don't understand you. I don't smash your face only 'cause I feel sorry for you! Let's go. Let's go! Have you gone crazy? He doesn't understand and doesn't want to. Comes up here to play the jealous husband! Clara, you coming to the movies later? Come on. Don't let it get to you. Take some sweets to your brothers. No, I won't. You have to think about them. Come home soon. I can drive up and get you. Bye, Franco. Come take a walk with me on Wednesday? A walk? I can't on Wednesday. I have a date. My love. You know what I fell in love with? Your hands... and then your eyes. For me, it was everything. Really. This is delicious. You came into my life when my husband slapped me. Your husband is a louse. Don't say that. He doesn't have an easy life, poor guy: He struggles too, and he's not a bad man. Well, you're a good woman. I don't understand anything anymore. Since I've been here, everything's changed right before my eyes. Nothing could have happened between us in Milan. I shouldn't drink anymore. It makes me want to laugh. Go on, drink! Laugh! We have to keep our heads. But why do we have to keep our heads? Would you have the courage to divorce? If you don't have money... you can't divorce. The law won't give you a divorce for free. It doesn't cost much. For people like you and me, it's still too much. Only some madness could resolve our situation. We'll run away to Germany. They need specialists like me. You're a dreamer. You sound like one of my kids. And what about them? And what do I do with the children? Toss them aside? Didn't think of that, did you? Let's not be so serious. Let's enjoy these moments. Let's not think of anything. So what's this madness you spoke of? You should have guessed. You have no imagination. Well? I'm not going to tell you. It was very selfish anyway. Throw myself in front of a train. That's my madness! I'll always be with you. I won't give you up. Milan has a way of knocking the love out of people. God, it's late! See you next Wednesday. Excuse me. Did you have a pass? No, I didn't. They were looking for you. They even called the police. I'll explain everything tomorrow. These things happen. Dr. Ciranni came looking for you three times. You ladies mustn't miss the medical exam tomorrow. Good news for you, Clara. You're cured. Totally cured. Happy? You're totally cured. Let Dr. Ciranni tell you. He's your doctor, your healer, and fellow townsman. The director is right. You're cured. You can go. You can return home. Today, if you wish. Today? If you'd rather... tomorrow will be fine. There's a train today at 2:00. It'll still be daylight when you get there. I've written up your report... for National Health. Take it to Milan. The head nurse will give it to you. Don't go back to the factory immediately. Let a few days go by. Don't think of anything. Have some fun. Best wishes, Clara. I... I thank you all. All of you, really. Thank you so much, Doctor. Have a good trip, Clara. Thank you. Everything okay? This was just delivered for you. ''Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday. Luigi.''
