A BOX OF FAITH (2015) - FULL TRANSCRIPT

foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- - [Tim] How was school? - [Dior] It was okay. - [Tim] Any homework? - [Dior] Did it. - [Tim] Anything interesting happen? - [Dior] A kid got mad at his mom over a kale salad. He called her the B word. - [Tim] If my father found out I called my mom that -- - He'd wash your mouth out with soap. - He probably didn|t mean it. - No, he meant it. He wanted a sandwich, not a salad. - How was your sandwich? - It was good. - Not as good as your mom|s? - No. - You didn|t eat it? - (laughing) No. - [Tim] It was that bad? - No, I traded it for a salad. - I was thinking, we should head north again and take a little vacation. Get a boat, cruise the lake. Maybe we could rent one of those cabins. Wouldn'|t that be fun? - That|'d be amazing. - Oh, check your ticket. Did you win? - We won another free chicken basket. - You'|re the luckiest person I'|ve ever known. Not much to sell in here any more. Your mom loved that thing. You should take it. I know she'd love for you to have it. - I'|ll give you 50 for it. - 50? Cost close to 400. - I| got a lot of watches and they|'re not selling. - How much do you sell them for? - This one? About 150. - Nice markup. - You want the 50 bucks or not? - Fine. - All right, fill out this paperwork. I|'ll go get your money. - [Tim] This motel is costing me 55 bucks a night. I can|'t do this much longer, I need our home back. If we give you another 500 this Friday, can we move back in? I don'|t have 750. Okay, I'|ll get it. Just, don'|t rent it, please. (melancholic music) My peace I give unto you. Not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. (grinding) (ominous music) Night, Terry. - Have a great weekend, Mark. - You, too, Ben. Thanks. - Later, Mark. - Sorry, Tim. I|'m gonna have to report this. - So what should we do about this? - I didn'|t put that there. - Well then who did? - I don'|t know. - I took a chance on you. And this is how you pay me back? - I didn'|t put it there, I'm telling the truth. - This is your original job application. "Have you ever been convicted of a felony?" And you wrote, "Yes, class 6, non-violent." - That was 17 years ago. I was a stupid kid running with the wrong crowd. - Did you know that 74% of employees steal from their employers? - Come on Ben, what'|s going on here? You know me. I'|m telling the truth, I didn'|t put it there. - And one out of 30 employees are arrested for theft. - You'|re not listening to me. I'|m being set up. - And over 50% are men. You fit the mold, and I trusted you. - So I|'m fired? - Fired? No, you'|re going to jail. I|'ve already called the police. (birds chirping) (upbeat music) - [Voiceover] I was told they checked in here 2 days ago. - [Voiceover] Yeah, but his truck'|s not here. How could anyone get in there? - I need to check inside. - No, I'|ve got to protect the privacy of my guests. - Can you open the door? - [Motel Manager] No. - [Ms. Ward] Do you have children? - Yeah, I have a daughter. - Okay, how would you feel if your daughter was living out on the streets? - Thank you. Dior? Are you in here? - See, she'|s not here. Hey, I don'|t feel comfortable with you going through that stuff. - Oh right, protecting their privacy. Look, I really need to find this girl soon. So if you see her, can you call me immediately? Here|'s my card, okay? - Is she in some kind of trouble? - No, she isn'|t in any kind of trouble. Her father is. Her mother passed away, she has no other family. She'|ll be in our custody until we find a foster home for her. So please, can you call the number on the card? I'|ll come pick her up straight away. Can you at least do that for me? - Okay, I'|ll call you. - Okay. (light hearted music) - Lord, help me through this experience and I'll be a great warrior for you. - Okay. Uh huh. Well, if she does show up, can you give me a call please? Thanks, bye bye. (phone ringing) - Hey, I just got an update on the father. - Hold on, I'|m gonna pull over. Okay, go ahead, Steven. - This is his second felony. - Right, I know, what else? - His boss is not letting up on this. The bail is set at 25,000. The judge is pushing for three to five. - Three to five? Seems extreme, no parole? - I don'|t think so. - Why are they being so harsh on him? - It|'s the employer. He'|s trying to make an example of him. You there? - Do you think you might be able to arrange a meeting with Strickland? - I|'ll see what I can do. - Cheers, Steven. (upbeat music) - That|'s my bag! (car horn) (car horn) (relaxed music) (background TV) What are you doing? Give that back to me! What do you mean no? It|'s mine! That was my mother'|s. It means a lot to me. Thank you. Wait, do you want this? Take it. Thank you. Thank you. Where are my clothes? - Have any of the staff been in here recently? - No. - Huh. She'|s been in here. - I don'|t think so. - Well, somebody has. - Listen, I gotta get back to the front desk. This door will lock when you leave. - Okay. (door closing) "Dior, you will always be my baby girl. "I am so proud of you and how you are able "to inspire everyone around you. "Keep up the great work and be strong. "Love, Mom." There you are. Come on, Dior, where are you? (relaxed music) (car engine) (tense music) (door unlocking) (banging) (door closing) (background TV) Where are you hiding? - [Voiceover] Dear God, thank you for the wonderful home you|'ve given me today. I don'|t question you, but I wonder how long you need my dad. Hope it'|s not long. I know you have some plan for him, so I will be patient and stay here until he returns. Love, Dior. (storm rumbling) (unsettled music) - [Manager] I've gotta protect the privacy of my guests. - [Ms. Ward] Can you open the door? - [Motel Manager] No. (car horn) - [Voiceover] You can stop following me. I'm doing fine. God takes care of me. - [Voiceover] Dear Dior, I mean you no harm. I only want to help you and put you in a place that is safe. I just ask that you trust me. P.S. thanks for the help with my crossword. - Hey, Ray? Can you pick me up? I need to leave my car somewhere. (scratching) (rattling) (rattling) (playful music) - Hi, there. Boy, you'|re a fat one, aren'|t you? 'Futt'. What kind of name is that? Well Futt, I think you found yourself a new home. Well, of course you'|re hungry, pudgy boy. (background TV) - [Voiceover] Dear God, thank you for my new companion. He's great. I think he eats more than me, so whatever extra help you can afford would be greatly appreciated. Love, Dior. (pleasant music) - Come on. You|'re not going to be able to keep up with me, are you? Come on. (upbeat music) - Look, I|'m really sorry about being late. - You don|t understand. This girl has been really difficult to find. I left her a note, I want to be there when she finds it. - Why don'|t you let the cops find her? - They won|'t, this is one smart girl. - Looks like she might have left us a note. I'|ll be right back, okay? - Well? - She left me a note. - "I don'|t need your help, I'|m doing what I "need to do until my father returns." - That|'s gonna be a long wait. - "Thank you for the money, but God watches over me." - You gave her money? I can'|t believe you gave her money. - I'|ll see you back at the office, Ray. - Okay. - Where you going? Think she'|s setting me up, Futtman? Stay here. - [Voiceover] Dear Dior, I don'|t think you understand what is going on here. Your father may be gone for a few years. He is going to prison. Please just give me five minutes so I can explain. - You wanna talk? - About what? - Oh I don'|t know, maybe about you making this too personal? - Oh, and you don|'t care about these kids? - Of course I do. I just know how to keep it separate from my life. - This is my life. These kids need a chance. - Yes, and that'|s where we come in. - That doesn'|t fix it. What, you think because we put them in foster care or we take them from their parents it'|s all better, Ray? - I didn'|t say that. - Well, what are you saying? - I'|m saying, we do the best we can with what we have to work with. If these kids choose to do something with themselves, great. If they don'|t, it|'s not our fault. It|'s not your fault. - That|'s just giving up on them. - It|'s just a job. - Not to me. - I think there's more to this than what you|'re telling me. - She just deserves better. - Are you sure we'|re not talking about you? Why are you so interested in this case? - She lost her mother. Her father|'s going to prison. She has no relatives, no siblings, no one. - All of these children have similar situations. - No, this one is different. She'|s incredibly intelligent. She'|s gifted. - And what about Jose? Or Aaron? Or Shantell? What, they'|re not? - Look, maybe you'|re right. - It'|s not about me being right or wrong. - Some of these kids don'|t wanna make anything of their lives, but not this kid, Ray! - I think you'|re getting a little too attached to this case. - It'|s not a case, Ray. It'|s a person. A young girl who deserves a chance to lead a better life, to grow up and have an impact on people|s lives, okay? - Looks like we'|re gonna be here a while, Futtman. We need a plan. (relaxed music) - Where have you gone? - Any luck? - No, it|'s like she vanished. - You know she can probably see you sitting here watching the car, right? - Did you come here to give me a hard time? - No, I|'m just saying she can probably see you, that'|s all. - [Ms. Ward] Do you think I don'|t know that? - Why don'|t you move farther away from the car? Like over there? - Do I tell you how to do your job? - No. - Ray, why are you here? - They'|re gonna move her father to an out-of-state facility. Are you gonna stay here all day? - If that'|s what it takes. - See you back at the office. - Goodbye, Ray. Why didn'|t you tell me they're moving him? - I left a message with Ray. - I|'ve read his report. This guy shouldn'|t even be in jail. - Look, I|'m as surprised as you are. But I gotta tell you, he'|s not getting out any time soon. - I need to meet him. - So you|'re serious? - Yeah. Can you arrange a meeting? - All right, we have to do it right away 'cause they'|re moving him pretty soon. - Okay, yeah. Cheers, Steven. Call me when you set it up, bye. - [Voiceover] Dear Dior, I'|m sure you'|ve been looking everywhere for this photo of your mom. I thought the need to tell you a little about myself was necessary. I know what you are going through. I lost my mother and have no idea where my father is even to this day. So when I say I know how you feel, I mean it, because I|'ve been in your shoes. I know you say God takes care of you and I believe he does. But maybe God is directing me to you. I will not give up on you and I pray that you are safe. - Hey, Ray. Listen Ray, I'|m sorry. I lost track of time. I spotted the girl so I know she|'s around here somewhere. Ray, did you hear what I said? I just saw Dior, I can'|t leave. Bye, Ray, look I gotta go. (melancholic music) Hello, Dior. - Hi. - It|'s nice to finally meet you. I'|m trying everything I can to get in touch with your father. - The only way across is way down there. - And if I go down there, you'|ll run away, won|'t you? - Probably. - I could call the police and have this place surrounded, you know. You don|'t belong out here. - And if I go with you, you'|ll just stick me somewhere where people don'|t care about me. - I can see there'|s no talking you into it, is there? - I|'ve got everything I need right here. He takes care of me. - What|'s his name? - Futt. - Sorry, what'|s his name? - Futt, F - U - T - T. - What kind of name is that for a dog? - It|'s on his collar. (Ms. Ward laughs) - So he belongs to somebody? - Probably. - Just like you. - I should get going. - At least let me give you some money for a motel. - I don|'t need any money, I|'ve got it all under control. I have a place to live. - Oh, you do, where? It was worth a shot, right? Dior? I|'m sorry to hear about your mother. - I|'m sorry to hear about yours. - I'|ll be checking on you. You know, make sure you'|re okay. - Okay. - He likes ice cream, huh? - He likes everything. - Looks like he can use some exercise. Why do you have him in that stroller? - Well, he can|'t keep up with me. - So how long you been on the street? - Who says I live on the street? - Well it|'s pretty obvious. You don'|t wanna look obvious. You wanna blend in, otherwise they'|ll see you. - Blend in? - That|'s what I do. Here. How long has it been since you'|ve eaten? - I couldn'|t find any food yesterday. - Here you go. So where do you sleep? - Under the bridge. - That|'s not very safe. - Where do you sleep? - Well, I have a place. And you'|re welcome to stay with me until you figure things out. - You live here? - Shh, we gotta keep quiet. - So I can stay here? - Yeah, I have a sleeping bag that you can use. - [Girl] Cool, thanks. - We just have to be careful coming and going. I mean, if anybody knew that we were living here, it'|d be over. And I do ask that you spend a couple of hours keeping up with your school studies. - School studies? - Yeah, everyday. You okay with that? - Sure, why not? Well, everything was good until my mom and dad got divorced. Minute that happened, my dad moved away. Then my mom married this, I don'|t even know what you|'d call him. He was nice at first, but then he became a jerk. My mom acted like it was nothing at all. So I was like, "I|'m outta here." - I|'m sorry to hear that. - What about you? Why do you live in this storage unit? - My dad's in some kind of trouble. And they wanna put me in foster home, but they can'|t catch me. - Why don'|t you live with your mom? - She died. There is a woman that|'s trying to take care of me. I think she'|s from the state or something. But I just don'|t want to live in some stranger|'s house, you know? I have everything I need right here. - How did you score this place? - It'|s my dad'|s storage unit. - How do you have all that food and stuff? - Well, he helps me. Plus, there are ways to make money. You just have to work hard and pay attention. So what do you want in your life? - I guess, for things to be back to the way they were. - You want things to be resolved? - Well, yeah. But that won|'t happen while he'|s around. - What if I told you that miracles can happen? - I'|d say that you'|re full of it. What'|s that? I found it in my mom|'s things. But basically this is how it works. You write a note to God, you put it on the ceiling, and then in the night, he takes it. In time, all your problems get worked out. - That|'s the stupidest thing I ever heard of. - Well, it'|s true. - And then all your problems are solved? - Yeah. Try it, what have you got to lose? - I think that you'|re crazy. - Think what you want, but it works. - Prove it. - Write a note to God and ask for some sort of help for something in your life. - This is stupid. - Just close your eyes and think. - Okay. Got it. - Write it down and make sure it|'s addressed to him. - "God, please give me a new pair of shoes." - Okay, now it'|s my turn. "Dear God, "thanks for my new friend. "Love, Dior." - You didn'|t ask for anything. - Well sometimes I just thank him for all that he|'s done for me. Now put it up there. And make sure the words are facing up. - So what do we do now? - We wait until morning. - Do you ever miss your mom? - Every day. The hardest part is that I'|ll never be able to talk to her ever again. - What was she like? - Smart. Funny. And strong. She liked to hug me a lot. - She sounds nice. - She was. - Hey, wake up. Wake up. One of them is still there. Yours is gone but mine's still there. - I don'|t understand what happened. - I don'|t believe in it anyways. (buzzer) (door unlocking) (ominous music) - Step forward. - Mr. Strickland, my name is Ms. Ward and I'm from child protective services. - [Tim] How's my daughter? - She|'s, your daughter'|s fine. But I was hoping that you might know where she is. - What do you mean? You don|t know where she is? - I ran into her in the park. - In the park? - She looked okay. I just don|t know where she'|s living at the moment. - Did you check the motel? - Yes, she|'s gone somewhere else. - So you guy|s lost her? You don|'t have any idea what you'|re doing, do you? - Wait a minute here. I|'m not the one who put a tool in my lunch box. - I didn|'t steal anything. - Tim, they found stolen property in your lunch box. - So now we'|re on a first name basis? - I|'m sorry if the system has put you in a bad spot. - The system is responsible for a 16 year old girl wandering the streets. - I absolutely agree. That|'s why I want to find her. - And what are you gonna do with her if you find her? - We'|ll take her to a place where she|'ll be safe. - Safe. In a halfway house full of runaway street kids. - Fine. You know, thanks for your help. - [Tim] What do you wanna know? - Anything you can tell me about her. - She|'s been through a lot. She lost her mom two years ago. She|'s intelligent. That|'s why you'|re not going to find her unless she wants you to. Never had to push her to do anything. She'|s really focused. She'|s smart. So smart. Smarter than I am. She|'s gonna be something someday. - I can tell you love your daughter very much. - I|'ve let her down. - Do you know where she might| have gone? With a relative or maybe a boyfriend? - No. Just remember, she|'s very resourceful. - Tim, I'|m gonna find her. - [Dior] Okay, so after the cells divide, what'|s that phase called? - I really don|t wanna do this anymore. - But you agreed to the rules. - So if I don'|t do your rules then I have to leave? - You think that just because you ran away you can'|t think about your future? - You|'re starting to sound like my mom. - Well this isn'|t it for me. I'm gonna make something of myself. - Well why don|'t you go to school if it'|s so important to you? - Well that'|s out of the question. But, you did agree to study if I let you stay here. - I'd rather live under the bridge than put up with all these rules. You'|re starting to sound like my mom. - Then go. Go. (gentle music) You know, I think you should go home. At least you have a mom that can be worried sick about you. - No, you're right, I'm sorry. I'|ll keep up with my school stuff. I want to stay. - Good. Well, I'|m gonna take Futt for a walk. You wanna come with? - Um no, I have some things to do. - Okay, we'|ll meet back here at five? - Okay. (peaceful music) - This is beautiful. - It was my grandfather'|s. He was stationed in France in the great war. - Why are you selling it? - Honey, I| got too much stuff. I don'|t have anybody to leave it to. You live around here? - Yeah, right around the corner. - I'|m Opal. - I|'m Dior. Does it work? - Not any more. Used to. I haven'|t had the time to get it fixed. - How much are you selling it for? - Well, I was asking 25. You know what? Just take it. - I couldn'|t do that. - Okay then, one dollar. - Deal. Stay right here, Futtman. - Who|'s this? - I fixed it, Futtman! - Futtman? Futtman? Futtman? Hi, Emma. Hi, what'|s goin' on? - I lost Futtman. - You did? Well let|'s go look for him. - I did, everywhere. - He'|ll show up. - I was busy fixing this watch and I lost track of him. - What'|s it worth? - I|'m going to find out. - So what|'s it worth? - Did you open it up? - Yeah, it had some gears out of place. - You fixed the gears in this watch? Really? - She'|s really smart. - You scratched the bezel getting the back off. It|'ll have to be replaced. So you repaired it? - Yeah, what'|s the big deal? - You didn|'t steal it? - No, what'|s it worth? - I'|ll give you 15 for it. - 15, that'|s it? - Well, I can probably buff the scratch out. I|'ll go 1,600. - Thanks, anyway. - All right 1,800 but that'|s as high as I can go. - You and I both know this is at least worth 4,500. - Look, I have to make a profit. - Yeah, but do you think a 150% mark-up is fair? This isn'|t just some ordinary watch. This has historical significance. An American soldier from World War One purchased this. Who knows, it could have belonged to General Pershing. - 2,500 that'|s as high as I can go. - All right, you'|ve got yourself a deal. (upbeat music) - Wait just a second, girl. How did you find out how much the watch was worth? - I didn'|t. I would'|ve taken 20 bucks for it. - Then how did you figure it out? - Well, I knew he wanted to make a profit of about 200%. So I calculated the 1,500 and then added it to 200%. - Which is what? - 4,500. It|'s simple math, Emma. - But what about all that stuff about the war? - It|'s all in books. Let'|s go find Futtman. (door knocking) - Did you find it? - Yeah, I'|ve dealt with this one before. Runaway, shoplifting, priors. Parents seem nice. She just doesn'|t like authority. - Hm. - I|'ve done this three times with her. Is that her? - That|'s her. Saw her today at the park. - Doesn|'t surprise me. Anything new on that Strickland girl? - Yeah, I met with her father at county. - Really? - He seems like a sweet guy. - I'|ll bet. Bet he thinks he'|s innocent, too. - Thing is, I don|'t think he would do this to his daughter. What, risk going to prison? She|'s all he'|s got. - Look, you'|ve gotta stop trying to the save the world. - I'|m not trying to save the world. - You need to detach a little bit from this case. Some of us are going out after work tonight. Why don|'t you come with us? - Oh, don'|t do this to me, Ray. - Come on, get out of your little apartment. Have some fun. - If I say yes, will you get out of my office so I can get some work done? - Yes. - Okay, I'|ll go. Now get out of my office. Bye bye, Ray. - Is this it? - Yeah. I thought there was something funny going on here. So I planted a security camera in the break room last night. - [Manager] Is that Terry? - [Ben] Watch, he|'s gonna put a tool in Mark'|s lunch box. - [Manager] So Mark would get fired? - [Ben] Yes. - And Terry would get promoted. - Uh huh. - Probably did the same thing to Tim. - You want some? - No, I|'m good. - What are you writing? - I'|m just asking God to free my dad. - You haven'|t asked that before? - Well, normally I don'|t question God|'s decisions, but I|'ve had enough. I just want my dad back. (door knocking) - Sit, Terry. So, how are you liking Tim|'s old job? - It|'s good, pays more. - Did you hear about Mark? - No, what happened? - We caught him stealing. - I never even trusted that guy. - He never struck me as the dishonest type. - Some guys will surprise you. - We may have to let him go. - Well, he made his own bed. - It'|s unfortunate. Mark was a good man, hard worker. A lot like Tim was. - Look, I gotta get going. It'|s getting kind of late. - [Manager] Sure, one more thing. - When did you put a camera in the break room? - Keep watching, it gets better. I almost fired Mark and promoted you. You wanna know the sad part about this whole thing? - You'|re firing me? - Besides that. Tim went to jail for something you did! The police are in the other office waiting for you. I just asked to have a word with you before they took you away. (phone ringing) - Hey Steven, what'|s up? - You are not gonna believe this. - Oh, what|'s happened now? - Strickland didn'|t do it. - What are you talking about? - Your guy was set up. Did you hear what I said? - I heard you. When are they releasing him? - Tomorrow. - Does he know? - [Steven] Not yet. - I'|d like to be the one to give him the good news. Can I do that, Steven, tonight? - Sure, if you want. - Tell them I|'ll be there in 20 minutes, okay? - I'|ll let them know you|'re coming. - You can take the cuffs off. We won|'t be needing them anymore. - Tim, I have good news. - You found Dior? - No, but we will. You|'re being released. - What? - One of your co-workers admitted to planting the tool in your lunch box. - So I can go? - Once the judge signs the paperwork, yes. Unfortunately, that won'|t be until tomorrow. - Did they say who set me up? - Yeah, some guy named Terry. - He seemed like a decent guy. - Anyway, one more night and you'|re free. - Um... do you think it'|s possible for you to come pick me up tomorrow? - Yeah, of course. Once the judge releases you I'|ll be here. - Thank you. - You'|re welcome. - Then go find my daughter. - We|'ll find her together, I promise. (ominous music) (majestic music) - [Voiceover] Dear Emma, I|'m sorry our friendship didn'|t work out. Take this money and go home and work things out with your mom. Dior. (phone ringing) - Oh, Ray. I am so sorry I forgot to call you. - I knew you weren'|t going to show up. - No no no, it'|s Strickland. They|'re releasing him. He'|s innocent. - Innocent? Wow. - I|'ve been down at county. So maybe next time. - I get it. I|'m not your type. - Ray? I don|t know what to say. - Okay, well um, have a good night. Hey, Ward? - Yeah? - I was wrong about what I said earlier, all right? Don'|t change. Just stay the way you are. It'|s people like you that make the world a better place. - Thanks, Ray. (upbeat music) (sighs) (giggles) (background TV) - Thank you for picking me up. - You'|re welcome. - So where do we start? - The park by your old house. - I|'m guessing you|'re pretty mad at me? - I feel sorry for you. - Me? - Yep. You have people that care about you. But you run away. - You don|t understand. My mom doesn'|t care about me. She only cares about him. - It|'s probably nothing like that at all. Go home, Emma. Go home and grow up. - I came here to apologize and you'|re acting like a jerk. - Run away. Isn'|t that what you do when you don|'t like what you hear? - I saw your dog. - Where? - I|'m not going to tell you. Oh, and by the way, I'|m calling the police, and I|'m letting them know you|'re living in that stupid storage place. - So this is where you saw her last? - Yeah. - That'|s her dog! - She has a dog? - This is her dog. She'|s gotta be around here somewhere. - Futt! (emotional music) Dad? I thought you were in jail? - They caught the guy that did it. - I knew you didn'|t do it, dad. - Where have you been living? - In our storage unit. - You|'re kidding? - And Futtman'|s okay, too. - Thank you. - You|'re welcome. - Thank you. - You|'re welcome. (giggles) - You bought a broken watch for a dollar, fixed it, and sold it for 2,500? - So now we can go home. - That|'s your money. You earned it. - Dad, I only earned it because of what you|'ve taught me. - Well, it would be nice to leave these motels. - And you snore. - No! - Yeah, like a lot! (giggles) (phone ringing) - Who the heck could that be? Hello? Hi. - Don'|t eat that on the bed. - Okay. Right. I|'ll see you tomorrow then. - Who was that? - My boss. I got my job back. - That|'s awesome! - It'|s like it never happened. We got our life back. (background TV) Chinese? - Sure. You wanna invite Ms. Ward? - What? Why? - Come on, dad. I saw the way you two were looking at each other. She'|s a very nice person, dad. - I hardly know her. - Well then call her and invite her to dinner. - You'|re serious? - I think it'll be good. For all of us. - I can'|t call her. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hi, this is Dior. My dad was wondering if you'd like to have dinner with us tonight. - Tonight? - Yeah, tonight. She likes you. - What did she say? - Hello? - Oh, my. - Hello? - Sure, yes, um -- - Hold on one sec. - Seriously, dad? - When, I mean, where? - I don|t have any clothes, Dior! - My dad doesn|t have any clothes.
