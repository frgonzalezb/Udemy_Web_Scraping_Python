Isn't that weird it's such a long word, abbreviated. Oh, my god. I know you. Oh, oh, uh, I don't... You did Scars at that Silverlake church, didn't you? Oh, yeah. You were amazing. Oh, thank you. That's sweet, thanks. Thank you. I was like eight, and that show made me want to be a dancer. Eight? You're such a star! Hm. Wow. Tomorrow is my birthday. Happy birthday. You might still be here the way this is going. Thank you. Uh, you can go ahead of me if you want. Shit. Dear David, You have always asked me for the truth. The truth is you're still my best friend. The truth is birthdays just aren't the same without you. Please come celebrate with me. We will have your favorite cake and this time you can even wear the purple hat. But it's my last show tonight and I need to leave by 5. So get here in time, OK? Funny how birthdays make me think of you, David. Then, again, everything does. So here is another truth, the truth is I miss us, David. The truth is I was wrong. Maybe I don't know what the truth is anymore. Maybe the truth just is. Hey, honey, it's me. Happy Birthday. So I'm here at the theater, you're not. Multiple choice, what's wrong with this picture? Oh, my god, you guys actually wear floss as a costume. I wish my brain could unknow this. All right. Well, call me back. OK? Five minutes to showtime. Five minutes to showtime. Romy? OK, I'm using my key. Romy, I'm coming in. I am traveling through the house. I know I'm late, but I can't be that late. Romy? Oh! God damn it. Son of a... Hey, babe, explain to me why at 36 I finally have my head together but my body is totally falling apart. Locked. OK, well, this is a little disturbing. You're writing snail mail instead of texting. You have house plants that are alive and can't be smoked. I hope you still have visiting pigeons. Come on, what's going on? Romy! Romy! David? Yes If it all goes to shit in the end anyway, what makes this all worth it? Honey, what happened? Hello? Let me call Aaron. OK? Sure, call everyone. Hey, this is Aaron. OK. I'll be there in fifteen minutes. I can't believe this guy made it so far. When I repped him he would have meltdowns over the weirdest things. Like he would call me at midnight sobbing because he needed his meds but refused to go to the drugstore. Why might he even do that? He was upset because sick people had to walk to the back of the store but healthy people could buy cigarettes up front. Can you believe how long ago that was? When did we all meet? 2006. Amazing. What do we call that decade anyway? The aughts? Zeros? Seriously, that says it all, doesn't it? Thank you so much for coming. It's not fair. She take drug like breath mint and she still pure as driven slush. Snow. Slush would be for fur. I'm sorry it's been so long since we've seen each other. I missed you. How's Robert? He's great. So when is fashion week? Maybe we should all go somewhere instead. God, that Paris flight kills me every single time. I would like to punch you in teeth. Oh, what? Is this one on your Transylvanian pearls of wisdom where jet lag is just in your mind and if you lick a clove of garlic... Aaron, Hello? Is that your brother? Maybe we can get him to come. How is he? What's wrong. Wait a minute, what? Is there drama? Excellent. What is the crisis? I want to know. If you die who is going to remember me when I was young and beautiful? When did you first realize you were getting old? Oh, that's easy. When I heard my favorite song, the one that changed my life. It meant so much to me that I listened to it for years, and years, and years. And they were playing it as easy listening in an elevator. Or the supermarket. That's the worst. Teens sprayed on a fricking pamphlet. Yep. Yep, that's when you know you're officially getting old. And the hope that things are going to change just kind of dies. It's the worst when you take away hope. Romy, who are you talking to? I try to deal with one day at a time. It's just that lately several days attack me at once. Hey, did she say what she wants? No, she's just talking to herself. And she was just talking about like Nirvana being played in a department store and dropping her keys and shit. She's talking crazy. Hey, hi, I'm here. What did I miss? Aaron, I sent you an email confirming my attendance and asking you what we needed but you didn't respond. So I can go back out and get more stuff if we need it. She has a gun. Holy shit. Way to bury the lead, David. Think we should call 911? Let's talk to her first and see what she needs. Mm, here we go. It's the Romy show. I know you both care so stop pretending you don't. Am I invisible here? What's going on? Wait, is this for real? What's happening? Hey, honey, everybody came. Aaron's here, and Jessica, and Ella, and Jaki, and we all love you. Why don't you come out so we can talk. Why don't I stay in here and we talk. Can't we just try and be honest for a few hours? Honest about what? You? Us? Both. Well, I for one have questions for all of you. Don't you ever want to make that tape loop in your head stop? I mean I can fake it with the best of them. Go out there, pretend that I get it, smile so much that my cheeks hurt. I don't want to go home. Shove needles in my eyeballs. You must have felt that too, right? At some point. You know where you're driving down Mall Hall and you just have this sudden urge to keep going right off the ridge. Just so you can feel something else. Or not feel anything at all. I just need you guys to help me figure this out. OK? OK? And I promise I'm not going to do anything crazy. Oh, my god. Romy, sweetie! Sweetie, are you OK? Oops. Romy, think about... think about a time when things were good. ...Kiss the ground that you walk on. You finally kiss me. We're going to be late. They're waiting for us aren't they? How long do we have? Hm? Five minutes. Five minutes. So you're expecting some sort of extended foreplay. Is that what you're saying? You need to stop. I need to stop? OK. I'll stop. That's totally fine, yeah. There's... try to find something in the kitchen to open the door with. Oh, my god. There's a window in the bathroom. Try to find some way in. Talk to her. Talk to her. Go say something. What is wrong with you? Romy, hey, it's Jessica. Listen, if you come out we can reminisce about the good old day. Huh? Thanks for coming. Glad to be here. All right so... hey, mama, how are you? Do you want gloves or do you want... You're in my way. So I wanna keep glass and I wanna keep the plastic separate. OK. So once this day grab from there to there. Here. Where is he? Combine these. Oh, yes. Good job. There's no trash over there. Come back. So what happened with the lawyer? Really? Love is in the air. Ooh, Loves in the air. Yeah. I'm crazy like a monkey. Ee, Oh. Happy like a new year. Yeah, Yeah, woo hoo. I'm crazy like a monkey. Ee, Oh. Happy like a new year. Yeah, yeah, woo hoo. Please come out. We can't get to the window from the outside. Well, try to tell Aaron that. I don't know what else to do. Listen, we're going to get her out of there. OK? She's going to be OK. It's not just that. It's... what happened to all of us? Romy, why are you in there? Beautiful Objects. Ooh. Sold their soul to portray a perfection. A beautiful object. True. I hang them from the walls and ceiling. Welcome to technical support. If you accept press pound and your call will be answered by our team in India. Thank you. Now listen very carefully because the menu has changed. If you got here because you're schizophrenic just listen to the little voices in your head to tell you what number to press. If you a co-dependant ask somebody to press one for you. If you're compulsive just press two over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over. If you're paranoid stay right there while we trace the call. And if you're bipolar just do whatever you want because who cares about you anyway? Hey, honey, it's me. You know how grateful I am that you are always there for me right? Have you ever cried so much that you have tears rolling in your ears? Champagne. There we go. Start talking. Marcus... good booking, non-committal, no condom, never called me again. And then Lance... made a fortune inheriting money. And um, he told me he's looking for somebody younger and hotter. Jerry gave me herpes. Ted cheated on me with his sister. I'm like, are you kidding? Peter, Seth, Barry, Josh, John, Tom, Thomas... and that's in a year. Sounds like a lot of miscellaneous dicks. That's a character description not an appendage. Thank you, Romy. I always wanted what you and Aaron had. You hate me, don't you? Huh? I don't know, I guess I just always hoped that somebody is going to come along and make everything OK. Nobody is going to make everything OK. You gotta do that for yourself, you freak. I know that. And I don't really know it. You know? No. Yeah. Whatever. I don't know. Come here, you. It's going to be OK. It's going to be OK. When was the last time you washed your hair? 11 days ago. It smells. I know. Thank you for coming. Of course. I love you. I love you too. Oh, how the fuck would she know how grateful you are when every single time you meet some random dude you forget you even have friends until that implodes. And then you come running back to us to help put the pieces together. Fuck you. Fuck off. You fuck off. What is your problem with me? How much time do you have? Were you born a dickhead? You know what, don't answer that. That was a rhetorical question for someone with a brain. Do you think anybody is intelligent who fakes rapt attention, any bullshit that spouts out of your stupid mouth. Go plop on a shore and start evolving. Shut up, both of you. Stop your bickering. I don't see what the point is now. Stop. Whatever you're doing out there. Just stop. OK? All right, fuck this. I'm calling an ambulance. Romy? Romy, where are your meds? Please stop. Yeah, how... unbelievable, they put me on hold. Romy... Please stop. Whatever you're doing out there. Just please stop. OK. OK, we'll stop. Aaron, the number is 1-800-suicide. When you don't want to live and you can't die. That's the dark side. I just need to be in here and I just need you guys to be out there with me. Hey, Rom, babes? I don't want to be alone. Just until it's light again. OK? Yeah, we'll stay. OK? We'll stay as long as you need. Why do I love dance? Because, to me, life is movement. In real life you know your eyes are glued to the ground in front of you. But when you dance, you have to look up. You can't think anymore. Your body takes over, transforms you. And it only exists for the second that it's inside your body and then it lives forever in your memory. Lets us know that we're all a part of eternity. I guess I just don't really like reality that much. I mean I don't know who in their right mind does. You know so when I'm dancing I can pretend that it doesn't exist. And every time that I think that I've closed the door on reality it comes in through the window. Didn't you ever wish for something more? Are you having panic fitella? No, I'm so freaking dizzy. What is this? You know I think it's nice this tradition you having birthday just the two of you. Yeah, I know. Can you believe we've done this every year for the last eight years? Let me get this straight. So you just add or take one tiny letter and it changes everything? Yeah, like hepatitis becomes hipatitis, which describes terminal coolness. Yes. Forploy is when someone misrepresents themselves in order to get laid. The scarecrow. Um, Sarchasm is a gulf between an author's sarcastic wit and the person that doesn't quite get it. I don't get it. I know, but you will. With your help. With my help. So the real reason we're here. Tavalodet moba... Tavalodet mobarak. Tavalodet Tavalodet. Mobarak. Tavalodet mobarak. One year before year 2010th birthday. You know Rage folded? Mm hm. And the world is missing yet another angry underground magazine where the editor is passionately decrying the injustices of our society. I think the world is missing it. Well, I don't. What's up with you, Ella? I don't know. I think it's the stress. I'm just totally nauseous. Just a sec. It's bad reason but it's nice to be all together again. Yeah, I know what you mean. How are things with Dad? You know how's working with him? He's fine. It's fine. It's called growing up. Used to call that giving up. I don't care. Hey, if you're happy I'm all for it. I'm just surprised. Is Terrence dead yet? Well, he probably isn't given that with the money you've shuffled in based on your warped genetics he could afford the best shit while you guys were exploring your dark side. Terrence died nine months ago. Before I went to rehab. I've been trying to tell you. I finally did it. I did it. I guess for his big. So we had the memorial. It was time. OK. OK. Hey, Romy, can we talk about Steve? Yes, I'd like to know what happened. I wanted him to love me. I needed him to love me. I would have done anything for that. Did you love him? No, but that wasn't the point. Welcome to the inauguration of the Parker Street bitch club. Hi, Jessica, how was Washington? Steve, this is Ella. Ella, Steve. He just shot our "issues" issue cover. Hm. You know what I realized when you were gone? I was so miserable it was almost like you were still here. Isn't that weird? And there are more reasons to bitch. In the 2007 homeless count there are more than 70,000 homeless people in LA County. 10,000 of which are children under the age of 18. The rents downtown are exploding. More and more people need affordable housing. And they're added on to people who are escaping violent homes and to the mentally ill, who are being dumped. I mean these people they're desperate. Yes, I'm still living with Romy. It's very nice. She no kick out after losing home. Of course not. You can stay with me as long as you like, gorgeous. OK. So tomorrow we're going to march on city hall during their meeting to prove even more unaffordable condos in development. I have leaflets in my car. Get some before you leave. This concludes my bitch, Thank you very much for listening. And to go along with your bitch... I guess that would be me. Was that you? Yeah. I made T-shirts. You know in support of all of our efforts and all of your efforts. Extra large. And that one's definitely yours. How big do you think I am? And you... Thank you. The newcomer. I like your variety and color. And that one is of course yours. Oh, how fitting, your inner bitch is finally having her coming out party. Hm, at least one of us is having one of those. Oh my god! OK, so who's turn is it to bitch next? Jessica. Yeah. I have a feeling it will be mostly about you. Hm, why does she dislike me so much? Oh, baby, she doesn't dislike you, she hates you. How's your mom? Still dominating the charts there is Belarus? Belgrade. Belgrade. See you haven't lost your voice. No, just found mind. I don't know what to do anymore. I love you. Is this a communication problem we're having? Because I'll learn your fucking language. Yeah. It's Russian. I don't care how many languages you speak. You're an asshole in every one. OK, two most romantic words. Killing Steve. Smoking section. Marry me. OK, my turn. 7 most disturbing words... you have no messages at this time. Wow. It's per diem. I think that we can do better though. Two sexiest words a woman can say? Save me. What do I win? I don't love you. Shadow, take me down with you for the last time. For the last time. I'm hoping I can change your mind. Who cares. So why did you do it then? Because he knew me. He knew what I wanted. He knew who I really am. With that fuck, not some Aristotelian proposition. You don't have to think about it. You just do it. Move, I got it. OK, Romy, you can either ask me to help me or you can tell me how you want it done, not both. You can help me organize shit. You know every time you come home put your keys in the same fucking spot. Every fucking time. So you wouldn't spend 10 minutes every single morning running around the house looking for shit. You know? I mean just put things in the same spot every single time and then you'd never look for anything again. Establish a routine and stick to it. Is it so hard? Is it so fucking hard to do that, to have some follow through? My god, you're stupid. I mean just throw shit out that you don't use. Your never going to need it again. It's not fucking brain surgery. Come on, this isn't about me looking for my keys every morning. You hate me, don't you? Why do you hate me so much? Because you love me. There must be something so wrong with you. We always thought you guys were so happy. I don't think she has any clue what that really mean. Why are you so angry with her? I'm not. But I was because she took you away from me. No, because... because I knew she would hurt you. Just like a record lady. Just like a record lady. Just like a record lady. Just like a record lady. Just like a record lady. Just like a record lady. I told you I didn't love you and you said you were OK with that. I lied. What do you want from me, Romy? I don't know. A little while ago I would have said a beautiful now. And some time of full of excitement and passion and life. But right this second, I'd settle for some sugar. Could you get it for me from the bar? What the fuck do you want from me? What do you want from me? When did life stop being beautiful. No, no, no, no, no. You see that's the problem. You never understood. There's more than just beautiful. Life just isn't like that, Romy, there are long, fast, stretches which are just boring. And that's normal. Why didn't you do anything about it? Because I didn't care. And you shouldn't either. I was just so sick of you moaning about LA winters. You know it's just not the same, Romy. So I don't know. Marry me. What? Marry me. Does it ever turn out like we expect it to? I though you got what you wanted. No. I didn't. Steve said I'm the only one he ever loved. Steve? When you were working together on our shoots? How do I not know this? You were too busy changing worlds. I was busy making models look pretty. And Steve was busy doing models. And then he tell me he want to be buddies. And I tell him, no, it's not how it work. I suck your dick you're not my buddy. Oh, my god. Now I'm in love with you too. I think that is the most words I've ever heard you say, Jaki. Oh, and here's more. You walk away from magazine like it's nothing. Whoa, OK. I think I kind of preferred the less words. Jaki, I didn't have anything to say anymore. You know there was nothing that I was passionate about. I think I was depressed. This is anger, with no enthusiasm. You want... how you say this? Bypass of heart. Bypass heart. In my country you do not give up. Do you understand? You cannot be tourist in your own life. She doesn't understand it either. Exactly. Hey. Hey. Sushi. Sushi. Uh, hi. Hi. I know I should have called you, but, uh, you know on the other hand... You have the wrong fingers. Yes. Uh, so you're getting married. Yes. Congratulations. Thank you. Is it someone that you know? Funny. Yeah. Very funny. It's super funny. We met a few months ago. Her name is Molly. Of course it is. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. She's safe. You know it's easy, it's simple. She worships me. She doesn't know you. That's true, but I don't want her to. It's easier that way. Four most infuriating words... I should have known. I wonder how you can get over it one more time. Believe it one more time. Keep going one more time. You have to keep going. You have no choice. I learned that growing up. Oh, that's rich coming from a girl who grew up on the mean streets of Hawaii. Aloha hi, la, la, la, la. Hey, asshole, I grew up in Detroit. My mom only moved us to Hawaii after my dad left the five of us to fend for ourselves during the worst winter ever. I think she figured that if she had worked three jobs to support four little girls that maybe she should do it in a better climate. Is that OK with you? OK but does that explain why you can't say one sentence without the word I or me in it? I don't. Enough! Enough! Enough! Newsflash, it is not about you. If I was her I would be out here threatening to shoot the both of you. I mean I love you guys but it's been what... seven years of us hanging out? And the entire time I kept wondering what's wrong with you. No, let me rephrase that. I kept wondering what self-inflicted psychological drama that you're going through this time. Has it ever occurred to either one of you that, contrary to popular belief, the world does not revolve around you? You could've just told me to shut up. I did. You totally go down. OK, this is now officially one of the few moments when I miss taking drugs. They made me feel good for no reason. I mean before they made me feel worse. I'm just being honest. OK? How clear are you on the concept, J? Honest like when you stole mom's bracelet and pawned it? Aaron, I tried to get it back but it was already gone. Did you know that Dad ripped the house apart because he wanted to find it so he could give it to you to make you feel better after Mom died. It is the only thing that he has left over and he wanted to give it to you. He still can't see what his little golden princesses is capable of. Golden princess? Yes, J, in his eyes you are still his gorgeous little perfect girl. The pretty one, made people stop on the street in awe. What a talent that is. God, you are such a cheap date. No wonder even my shy brother could pick you up. Hey, are you listening to me at all? Hm? So check it out. First I thought, I should write a travel book. You know because I'm a model. But then I realized it had to be a cook book. You know I love cooking. You know I do, right? What? Yeah. But you're a model. What would your recipe be like? It would be like stick two fingers down your throat and spew up everything that you've ever eaten in your entire life. And then chop up little bits of speed and put them in little nice piles. And then sort them. And then wash them down with more champagne. Ha ha. No, seriously, would that be it? Fuck you. It's amazing how quickly you can go from fuck you to fuck me. Hello? Hello? Put down, Romy. It's plastic. This place isn't that nice. You know what they say, when you run out of champagne you gotta order more cocktail. Oh, look, you have champagne. Romy, put that down. Why? Put it down or you're going to start french kissing the bar again. I'd rather kiss you. That's not funny. Why is that not funny? Come here. What are you doing? I'm going to give you a kiss. Fuck me. I stared out stained glass windows but I didn't see anything. I lived just like a shadow. I didn't feel anything. If there's a god in heaven, won't you tell him to let me in. I promise I'll be a good girl. I promise I won't give in. And you tell me, baby, I know that love can get so hard. Look out that window. You could be dancing in the yard. And I know it's crazy, but we've got to find a spark. Keep on burning and we'll be dancing in the dark. What's wrong? I'm Sorry, I can't do this. Oh, fuck you. You say that god's in heaven. He wants to let me in. I'll promise I'll be a good girl. I'll promise I wont give in. You tell me, baby, I know that life can get so hard. From fuck you to fuck me. We're back again. What were you thinking, J? I know I screwed up on so many levels. I'm sure I don't deserve a second chance. I'm not sure you do either. It's funny how alike you two are. Me and Ella? You and Romy. It's really why you didn't trust her. I'm sorry, Aaron. I'm so sorry. Hello? And mothers and fathers. Yes. Fathers and mothers. And fathers and daughters. You will have such a good time, my dear. Romy June, they will love you. Look at them. I'm nervous. Oh, you have nothing to be nervous about. All of these people have been doing this a really long time. I just started, Dad. I'm not going to be that good. How could they not love you? That's it, go. I will be here when you come out, OK? Promise? Promise, I will be right here. I won't go anywhere. OK. Love you. Love you too, June. That's where I fell in love with dance. It never changes. It has clear rules and the judgment is non-negotiable and fair. That's why it's better than life. It's beautiful. Fathers and daughters and mothers. Romy. Romy, what are you doing here? Nothing, don't worry. I just want to walk you home. Uh, OK. Can we go visit Daddy? And fathers and daughters. Hello? Yes. Mom. No, no, no. It's for you. It's the hospital. I can't. I can't, I can't. Yes, I, um, I understand. Thank you for calling. Maybe it's ironic that mama call me Mimi, like mi, mi, mi. But then she forgot to pick me up at grandparents' house for 15 years. Yeah, kind of. Or is it ironic that for a month she call every day saying she want to come to America for first fashion show because she is a lonely and broke. And then, forget to get on plane I pay for because she has new boyfriend. Elle, what would you say? Screw you. What she is trying to express so eloquently, Jaki, is that a lot of women do that. They try so hard to be in a new relationship that they forget the ones that they're already in. And then they forget themselves. They give away their freedom. What's going on, Elle? What's wrong. There's nothing wrong with being married. And there is nothing wrong with living in Newport Beach. And there's nothing wrong with me. Then, well, why are you crying? Because when we all used to hang out I used to think that when I get to my future, like when I get out of LA or out of the job that I thought I hated, I thought that I would have a present that I liked. I just find myself missing my past. Oh, I find that there's parts of my past I just... I don't want to miss. So Romy, Romina Saudi. You don't look Iranian. Anyway, you're here for the cleaning job. Excellent. And when can you start? How much do you pay? A cleaning job, flipping burgers, selling lace at that department store... all these jobs taught me something invaluable. That hard work pays off? That beauty gives you power. So if I paid you $200 to take some pictures would you do it? Just pictures, nothing else. You are so beautiful. You're such a beautiful girl. Just pictures? Just pictures. Suddenly, I understand. Even at 12 years old, you can discover that you have power when you thought you were completely powerless. I finally felt powerful. Baby, I'm so sorry I can't help you. I'm not feeling so good. I'm going to go lay down. I know. Could you take a look at these for me? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's OK. How did I miss that? Well, you weren't around anymore. Why didn't you tell me? Because she didn't want you to know. I know but I not understand. No. I hate this. No, we need custom invitation. Tell me, who has love best represented by kitten coming out of shoe? What is going on? I don't know, it's Beverly Hills. They probably found out there was carbs in the water supply and there was a mass exodus. I just feel so totally weird. You know? Like... it's like I'm drowning and I just, I can't. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. Romy, you love Aaron, no? Yeah. And Aaron loves you. Yeah. Yes, and we will make beautiful party. There's hair on chin. What? Young lady! Get it. Get it. It's like plucking stray eyebrow. Ow! That is not like plucking a stray eyebrow. I think I'm a shape-shifter. I become whoever you want me to be. You are far from what I want you to be. Now, stop. Stop drinking. I can't take it. Otherwise you'll be french kissing the tiles again. Why does everyone always think that I am into heavy petting with inanimate objects? Huh? I actually hate those tiles. Do you know how long we've been together now? I don't know. Five years, nine months, 29 days, and 10 minutes. Just so we are clear, I know. And it doesn't matter. What? It doesn't matter. None of it mattered to you and I'm still here planning a wedding. So how do you know that you matter? I do because I can see past your bullshit. You make me crazy, you make me happy, and I love you. Just don't do it again, Romy, or I'm going to have to kill you. I met you. You should tell them that you fucked the guy I loved with me in the next room. Oh, yeah, that. Yeah. He's here. Romy, he's here. He's here. He is walking up the driveway right now. He is walking up the driveway. He looks so good. OK, OK, honey, breathe. Hey, what's up? Hi. How's it going? Good. How are you? Good. You look good. Thanks. You too. David, can you hear me? Are you there? Oh, I'm sorry. What did you say? I got to go so just call me later. OK. All right, bye. OK. Yep. So who's this guy? What's happening? Why am I here? Because I need you to tell me what you think about him OK. I have not felt this way in like 10 years. Not since that asshole who shall remain nameless, James. And I thought I liked it like that, but I don't. I don't. And I don't know, it's like ever since I met Chris I just feel again. And I love it. I feel like I'm waking up to life again or something. Do you know what I mean? Do you know what I mean? Yeah, Oh, my god. I just... I want him to be my best friend. He inspires me. I want him to... I just want to be in his life. I want him to be in my life. I want him to be my life. And can you please stop giving me one word answers? Is that possible? OK. OK, you can come out now. You've made your point. Does that count that it goes up? I guess so. Yes, that's three sevens in a row. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven, seven. You're so good at this. I know. You're so good at this. I gotta go. You have to go what? Number two? I'm gonna go. I got to go. You don't have to go. Yeah, I gotta go. What, why? Why do you have to go? Because it's time to go. Oh, just, hang on. No, no, no. Please stay. Please, please, will you talk to him? He's so nice to me but I need to know more about him. OK? And he'll tell you He'll talk to you. Everybody talks to you. I love you. Man, you really tore my heart out and stomped that sucker flat. Why isn't Chris calling me? Do you think... you know what I think? I think I came... I come on too strong. I did. You know I think you should call him. Yes, definitely. You should call him for me. Answer it. Answer it. Answer it, answer it. Please, please, please, please, please. Answer it and tell him to come see you. Tell him to see you. Answer it. Answer it. How could you not know that she was in love with you? Look at you. What is this fuzz? When are you going to learn to shave? I would like to say its fashion but it's laziness. Look at you. Hi. This is our friend Chris. Oh! Could you be any cuter? Oh, gosh, look at you. Come on. Leave those. Leave those. It's OK. It is so nice to finally meet you, Romy. David has talked so much about you and he never mentions any of his girlfriends. Oh, really? I mean his father and I had almost given up hope. Wow, so you're still not out to your parents? I had no idea. That explains so much about you. Oh, yeah? Like what? Like why you don't have a life. I mean it would take a lot to clear that up for you. Well, the night is young. Yes, but you're not. That's good. What are you saying? I'm not saying anything. Do you have something in your nose? In my nose? Oh, come on. Salty. But it was good. I loved Chris. He had really clear eyes, like a baby. Aw, yes. Like baby cow that lost mama. Like Bambi. Yeah, there was just no malice in them. Wait, were you guys all just sitting around staring into Chris's eyes? That's not creepy to anybody but me? What was he like 12, 15, 18, one of those? He was sweet. I think, I mean I only met him the one time. I don't know how I'm hungry again. You do not understand. Just everything was starting to fall apart, David. No, you just found a good excuse to do whatever you wanted without any consideration for me, for us. You know I will never trust you again. You can't ever get that back. Oh, maybe I should just teach. No, you love doing it too much. Yeah, well, there's that. Mm hm. OK, he likes you, you like him. Do whatever you want. It's cool, I'm fine. Seriously. Totally. I know it's getting a little damp in here. Why do you think they call it happy hour when not one person here looks happy? Hey, look at this girl right here. Are you looking? She looks happy though. No, she looks pretty happy. Yeah, but I'm pretty sure there are clowns out there thinking maybe a little too much face paint. I don't know. Maybe she was thinking better well made-up then marked for life. Are you marked for life, Romy? Yes. Aren't we all? That it could last so long. Every day that passes by, our love it still stays strong. How could I have known that I would sing you this song? Happy Anniversary. Happy Anniversary. You know I think you had every right to be angry, but you had no right to be cruel. Hey. Six hours to think of something to say and all you can think of is hey. Shit. David, what the fuck? You said, you said that this is what you wanted. Yeah, right. This is what you wanted. It is not the same thing that I want. You said that I should do this. You said thing you were fine. Yeah, OK. Maybe I just thought you'd have heart enough to care. OK, OK. So you say one thing, expect me to understand that it means something else, and then you want me to do a third? What are you, like, the fucking oracle of Delphi? Now what? So I don't know what's going on with you guys but I want you to know that I love you both very, very much. These have, uh... these has been the best four months of my life. Basically, I don't know what to do right now so I'm just going to go. Don't fuck this up. OK? Just go. Please, just go away. I was talking to you, Romy. You're going to miss me. How can I miss you if you won't ever go away? Could somebody get me some water? I feel like I'm going to throw up. Congratulations, sweetheart. You know you're pregnant, right? No. Yeah. No. No. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. What am I going to do? Well, you put everything on hold and make little person priority. And... Find out that he thinks you completely ruined his life. And then wonder what happened to yours? Oh, David can be fun uncle who take little person on protest walks. Oh, yeah. I could take him to football games and teach him how to play baseball. Man, you really failed homo 101. No fashion sense, hates interior decorating, loves football. I'm going to be a mom. I gotta go. OK. I hope you won't forget us. And I hope you feel that despite everything we taught you something. Important things. Like the reasons Prince is sexy. That there is a difference between cream, off-white, and ivory. That a salad with no dressing, a diet coke, and a hot fudge sundae make a nutritious lunch. Why a call between David and me never lasts under 30 minutes. That crying can be fun. And that we will miss you. It's weird. I've been looking for something my whole life that makes sense and now it's finally here. What? Do I have something on my face? You look happy. I don't think I've ever seen that before. You didn't ever, you know, love me? Before Romy, of course. Even a teeny tiny bit? Not really. It's funny, I always thought that you were the answer I wasn't even the question. Mm. Hang on to that feeling. Hang on to that feeling. Don't you ever let it slip away. Hang on to that feeling. Hang on to that feeling. Don't you ever let it slip away. Bah! Cockroach! Cockroach! Where? Where? What do we do? Where's it at? Right there. I see it. I see it. I see it. Oh, god. Did you get it. Oh, my god. Look at this. Is it Romy's old shit? Look at this. It's you. It's me, my first cover. Can I look at it? Roach killer. Look at that, your wedding announcement. Yeah, she's a borderline hoarder. Aaron. Aw, look, when Bernie had dignity. David Hamm. Oh, my god. You can't make this up, can you? I think I'm going to write about this. What, her armpits? Yes, Jessica, her armpits. No! I mean this, tonight, all of us. You, me, getting older, saving a friend, saving the world. Hm, you're very pretty, Jessica. Thank you. It's been mentioned. Ella, how come you've never asked me one question about myself in seven years? Not one. Not how many brothers and sisters I have. Where do I... Brother... Drew. Assistant manager, works at Geek Squad. Your brother, Steve, he works a DMV in North Carolina. Your sister, Eleanor, she started a pet nanny service to the stars in Atlanta and then it went national. Well, it's Andrew and Steven. Not Drew and Steve. What's the first thing I said when I walked in Robert's house? Hi, money, I'm home. I was joking. I know. Hey! Do you remember the text that sent me after I left you like 900 messages begging you to call me back? Yep, it said if your phone doesn't ring, that's me. Next time I saw you was at the memorial. You know that? I found one of those words where you change one letter and it changes everything. Yeah? Ignoranus... someone who is stupid and also an asshole. Congratulations. What kills me is that the kid loved us both and I told him I didn't want to be friends anymore. And he forgave me. He's a better person than either you or me. Yeah, but that's easy. Where are you running, sweetheart? I see you trying to get there fast. What are you hoping for, sweetheart? Where are you running, sweetheart? What are running? There fast. Was just lonely without you guys, wasn't it? It's nice to have family back together again, isn't it? Hey, honey, it's me. Happy birthday. So I'm here at the theater, you're not. Multiple choice, what's wrong with this picture? Oh, my god, you guys actually wear floss as a costume. Damn, I wish my brain could unknow this. OK, well, call me back. Hey, you got anything? No. Damn. Wanna smoke? I don't smoke. Wait a minute, aren't you David? Closeted writer, human chimney? No, David, teacher, out and proud, and militant nonsmoker for actually four months now. That's weird. How come she doesn't know about this? I mean she talks about you all the fricking time. You know what? You annoyed me before I ever met you. Yeah, it's a gift I have. Prick. Five minutes to showtime. Five minutes to showtime. Now. I want to hold you in my hand. White light, sing your love to me. I am a stranger in your world. White light, do you still dream of me? I am so lonely in this world. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Come here. I want to hold you in my hand. I knew you could figure it out. The truth is, I was mad at her at first. But then I realized life is so brief. You know? We're here, we're gone. It won't ever be perfect. We all believe that we will live a million years and it doesn't matter how much time we waste. But we're like plants, we flourish and we die. It's not that complicated. Wait! Do you remember when you dressed up as a UPS man and delivered a package to Aaron just so you could see what he looked like? And do you remember when you signed me up to be a pet nanny to the stars so I'd stop trying to be a dancer? Do you remember when you made me crash my car outside that guy's house so he'd come out and save us, and he wasn't even home? Yeah. I love that about you. It was worth it. Every second of it. 7:05, Romy, showtime. Everybody's got a secret to hide. Everyone is slipping backwards. I can't remember if I like what I said. I can't remember it went straight to my head. I kept a bottle by the foot of the bed. I put a pillow on top of my head but I killed for love. I killed for love. Killed for love. Everybody's got a secret to hide. Everyone is slipping backwards. You say you see it almost every time. A little number counting back to nine. I can't remember if I like what I said. I can't remember it went straight to my head. But I killed for love. I killed for love. Killed for love.
