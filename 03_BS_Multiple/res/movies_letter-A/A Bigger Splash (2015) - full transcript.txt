foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Marianne! Marianne! Marianne! Marianne! I hate that sound. It's unknown. - Hello? - Aha! I found you. Guess who it is. Marianne, I know you're resting, but you have to be better. When it happened to Adele, - she was yodelling again in three weeks. - Harry. You think I didn't do my homework? Listen. - I'm landing in Pantelleria in five minutes. - Harry, listen, it's Paul. Meet me there and boy! - Do I have a surprise for you and Paul! - We're at the lake. Harry. I've got to go. I'm landing in five minutes. He's calling from the plane. He said he's got a surprise for us. I don't want that to be the last great thing I ever do. I mean, maybe you're my swan song, love! Jesus, does he ever stop? My god. Hey! Is it you? Is it you? Yes! God! I am so fucking happy to see you! Why didn't you let me know you were here? You know I love this place. I'm in Rome all summer. You can talk, can't you? Come on, tell me you're better. Yes, you are. What? Ah, what? Not at all? Well, the doctor said two more weeks. It's the kid. Hey! Come here, you old bucket. - You look fantastic! - Oh, thanks. You look sexy, kind of metro-sexy. I'm sorry we didn't call, but we're hiding out. What? Hiding out? Well, not from me. Come on! Not any more, anyway! Come on, when I'm finished with you, you'll be singing those gravelly Gs again. Oh, Penny, Penny, come here! Right, Pen, meet Marianne and Paul. - Hi! - Oh, you brought a protégée. - Nice to meet you. - I'm his daughter. - Excuse me? - The looks on your faces! I'm sorry, I should have warned you. Everyone's making the same mistake. Pen, say hello. Hi! Yeah, he really loves it, though. She seems shy, but she is a lovely bitch, like her mother. And underneath, she is every inch my girl, aren't you? - Yeah. - I think so. We're kind of.. - Where are your wheels? Let's go. - Uh, right in front. - So you didn't get a room? - Is that going to be a problem? Yeah. It's San Gaetano tomorrow. Ah! Shit. Yes. No, 'cause last year they did it late because of the ferry strike. Okay, anyway, doesn't matter. Oh, I know where we should go. We can go squatting at Fabrizio's. He'll put us up. But now, keep going, it's up here. There's a restaurant in the hills here and, Pen, you're going to love it. It's amazing. Fantastico! Pantelleria! Ta-da! You didn't know this was here? Don't tell me you've been eating out of the fridge all this time. They only serve dinner and only until September. Then it's fallow again until June. Harry, come on, that's a grave. Yeah, well, Europe's a grave. Oh, ah, fuck. So when did this happen, you and Harry? Last year. I finally put some pieces together and figured it out. Mm. You're on your college break? On your Grand Tour? Yep. Normally I'd be spending the summer in Connecticut with my mother, but she gets sick of me. Annie! She gets sick of me and she just ships me off somewhere. This year, it was to Harry. So... you again? Happy? Say yes. - Yeah, I'm fine. How are you? - Happy to see me? Oh, fuck. It's full. Shall we tell them who you are? Oh, we don't do that anymore, Harry. Well, I think we may have to 'cause it's absolutely choccer. Good evening. Good evening. - A table for four. - I'm booked, fully booked. Maybe tomorrow. - Marianne Lane. Do you know her? - No. She's famous. - It's Marianne Lane! - Who? It's Marianne Lane, that's her! The place is full. Rosario! Give him this table. Fine. A table just freed up. Go take a seat. Thanks. Okay, guys, we're good I think. Your name did it. Thanks! - Good evening. - Thanks. Do you know Marianne Lane? - Harry! - Hi. Unbelievable, my God! Good evening... Good evening, madam. It's Harry. Did you arrive from where? Oh, from Rome. Hello. Hello! - You look great! - Thanks! Everyone, this is Harry! It's the same group of people wherever you go. - So what are you going to have? - No, she can't talk, all right? I would love a daiquiri. - Marianne! - Have a daiquiri! Hotels are booked solid. There's meant to be one room left at the Yacht Marina and Piero says there's a queen bed we could use on the boat. At any rate, we got to get out and enjoy the weather tomorrow, 'cause the sirocco's on its way. That's the warm wind from the Sahara I was telling you about. - With rain? - No, it's dry, with sand. Marianne, Paul's headaches, are they a problem here? Harry, stop this fucking shit, all right? She can't talk. - I'm not going to repeat it! - Of course she can talk. When Bjork had her operation, after two weeks she was- I don't give a fuck what Bjork said, all right? Or Adele. No. Nothing's a problem here. Nothing a few Nurofen can't take care of. What is your name? What is your favourite colour? Seriously, you want me to deck you? Fucking... What is your quest? To not end up like Julie Andrews. Get it? Excuse me, four daiquiris. No, three... - Not for me. - Oh, fuck, shit, yeah, sorry. What, what, what did she say? - She says her feet hurt. - No! That's what she said. She's getting a blister. If you've got something to say, say it to me. She's asking you to stay. Oh, Christ, that took forever. - Is there a pool? - Mm-hm. Ah. Yeah, this place isn't bad, eh? Where are they? They're shooting a commercial in Thailand. Uh-huh. Well, where am I? No, it's down at the property. It's a little dammuso. It used to be a stable for the donkeys. Oh, far away. Safe distance, eh? Mm-hm! You can't talk or won't? Cancer? Oh, right. Your career. Cool. I'm 22, you know. Cool. Fuck! Woo! Woo! Look! Woo! Fantastic! Aha, okay. What have we got here? How are the pots and pans? Uh-huh. What have we got in the frigo? Oh! Scandalo. Orribile. Terrible. How are you guys living? What we have here? Your mum... huh? It's cute. You off to bed? Thank you. Mm. For having me to stay. All right. Here you go darling. Your pill. Good night. Good night. She's got tour dates this winter, doesn't she? What's she planning to do? Well, she's kicked everything into the long grass and it was the right thing to do. Jesus, man. It's hard to watch. Is she like this when you fuck? I mean, how does it work? Does she write you a note when she cums? Come here. You wish we were at a hotel. - I didn't say that. - You forget, I know how you speak. - Oh yeah, that's right. - Yeah. Mm? I've been teaching myself some Italian finally. Oh! 101 useful phrases? Well, no, I'm not reading Boccaccio if that's what you mean. Vaffanculo. Go fuck yourself. Go take it up the arse, in fact. Cacasentenze. Someone who pretends to be very smart, who won't stop talking, one who shits sentences. And my favourite is vomitare I'anima. To puke your guts up. Literally, to vomit your soul. Wow. I noticed you didn't drink at dinner. Are you all right? I mean, does it bother you that I'm drinking? Do you know what vai a cagare means? Ah, yeah. You know, well, there, you got it, just drop it, all right? Yeah, but are you all right? Hard part's over, yeah, rehab and all that. Yeah. Good night. Good night! Good night, good night! Phil, you've got to be fucking kidding me. Are you happy? The head of the label told me to my face that he considers those masters "Done" with a capital fucking D. If he's going to change his mind now... You asked him to stay. Why is that? You feeling nostalgic? Do you want to play that for me now? Don't let him know we can talk like this. You know we can't be naked any more, right? Marianne! Over here my swan. Oh, there you are! What have you got there? Oh, I've been waiting for you. - Have you? I was looking for you. - Sweetie. Mm. - Please, don't stop. - Can I play your drum? - My drum? - Yeah. We've got to leave at 11 o'clock. - No! Later. - The car's coming. - Later. Later. Make it later. - We can't move it. They won't be happy. They will not be happy. - Make it later. I'll make it worth it. - You will? Mm. What are you doing? Quit splashing. Look what a good job I'm doing, Clara! - Good morning. - Good morning. Hey, more surprises, huh? Where'd you find this thundercat? I can't get her off my elbow. What is thundercat? What is thundercat? What is thundercat? - Nonna I'd like to fuck. - Hey! Oh, yeah, you had nothing and now you have everything you need. Zucchini for Paul and a little heaven for everyone else. We're having for lunch orata al sale! How gross! Chilli, no! Just herbs. Herbs only, yes. I'm your slave. Hey! "I grew up in a Britain where racism was woven into the fabric of society "in a way that would be difficult to imagine today. "I was of a generation that challenged it politically and physically. "We confronted far-right thugs, organised street patrols "to protect black and Asian families and stood up to police harassment. "Patriots wish us to be equally unthinking in our attachment to the nation in every..." Oh. Ah. What the fuck's that? Is that a snake? Euch! No. It's just another whip snake. Ew! Orribile! Get rid of it! We have them every day. Pen! - How's the room of the ass? - A delight. How's the room of the monk? Oh, they made it! Great, great, great! Fantastic! You'll love them. Salty and sweet. Oh, you're fine. It's hot and they're communists and you're not speaking sweetheart, so I had to make other plans. - Hey! - Hey! Buongiorno! I want to go in that car one day, sweetheart! - Tchuff! - Tchuff! This is the house that Jonas has bought. You can make a hell of a lot more cash directing music videos than record producing, apparently. Oh, I shot a video with Jonas! Here she is. Here's the lady. Marianne, I'd like you to meet some very old friends of mine Mireille and Sylvie. Marianne Lane. She can't talk I'm afraid. That's rock 'n' roll for you. It squeezes you like a lemon, then it throws you out. Oh, but you're going to sing again! This is not forever. - And this is Paul. - Guess who I am. Oh, my dear. I know who you are. So lovely. You're daddy's little rascal we've been hearing about. He told me once that he'd lost six grand's worth of cocaine out in the parking lot. I mean, I've only seen that much cocaine in my life maybe twice. When he told me. I nearly had a fucking seizure in the green room. I... I couldn't let it go, the thought of it lying out there under somebody's Dodge Caravan or pick-up or whatever, so I got a dozen roadies to come out and shine their cell phones and torches under the cars while he finished his set. I mean, this is a stadium, remember, so thousands and thousands of cars and this group of roadies going around going, - "Where is it? Is it here?" - And they found it? No. They never found it. Somebody else won that lotto. He told me later that he had planned to kamikaze the whole lot that night and if he had, then we would've found him covered in shit and fizz the next day on the bathroom floor. Mm. But I think that losing that bag, it saved his life... for a while. To be a genius is to be unruled. To be unruled is to be alone. Well, er, yeah... for the first part maybe. - My sister has attempted suicide. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Twice. Pills both times. - Oh. It's the height of vanity, you know? You can't imagine her embarrassment when she discovered that she lived. Yeah, well, you know, no one should be ashamed. No. No. I tell her to call me if she feels it coming over her again. Now, every time the phone rings I resent her a little more - and I think that... - Oh! Mind your feet. - You can't live forever. - Exactly. None of us can. Oh, Marianne will. Ah, we've bored her. - Tchuff! - Tchuff! No, well, it was something unbelievable and that was when the Stones came into their own, so to speak. They killed their fathers, so to speak, in front of millions of people and the first real casualty of that was Brian Jones. Wait a second, I'm sorry. Don't you think we should kill the light in the booth? Yes, brilliant! Just right! - Good idea! - All right. Make it black as you can. Paint it black. I'll buy you a beer for that. What's your name? - Paul. Pleased to meet you. Hello. Hi. - Harry. Pleased to meet you. She's the woman of the century and I'm talking about her soul now. Underneath all the shit, the shellac, the noise, she's grounded. She's a fucking empath. When the spaceships come in, she'll be right out in front with her arms wide open, "Come, come to me, beautiful aliens!" You're an idiot, man, seriously. You should meet her. Why do you keep doing this? - We're done. - No, you're not. - Your bed's not even cold. Come on! - Paul, look at me. We're done. Marianne and I have different music to make, different... different shit. And on top of all of that, she's a trumpets-of-Jericho, white-hot fuck. - I don't want to hear it. - She fucks and she fucks and she fucks. Does she? - Yeah. - You don't want to do this, man. Yeah. Yeah, Tom. Tom, just, like, don't... Don't lay off that kick drum, all right? Keep it going like a heartbeat. That's it. Ba-pa-boom! Ba-pa-boom! Ba-pa-boom! Ba-pa-boom! - Are you happy Harry? - Uh, nearly. I'm not crazy about the sound I'm getting off the hi-hat. - Could we move the microphone? - Can we fix it and then can we go? - Can we fucking go? - I got it, Harry. Yeah. - Hey, praise fuck, you made it. Yeah! - Good to see you, man. Come here. We're just to go for a take, Paul. - All right. Let's hear. - Come, come, come. Uh, Marianne, Paul. Paul, Marianne. Hello! Onward pagan soldiers. Okay, let's go. Go, Harry! Go, Harry! Ah! Who won? - Harry... maybe. - Er, no, no, he won. Just about, just... just... Woo! Champion! See? I still got it. Oh! Sylvie! Ah! Three more boats have sunk here coming from Tunisia. I want you to send down Laurent and a photographer Check this out. Why are we listening to this? You want to end up in a padded room? Fuck. - It was on the turntable. - I know, but it's shit! What have we got here? No, no, no, Roxy Music, no. Uh-oh! Some of this is good shit. Ah, ah, ah, ah! Look what they have! Wait, where's Pen? Pen! Pen! Pen! Pen! Come hear what Daddy made! Come on! Okay, I think Marianne's heard this. Sylvie, do you know this album? I can tell you a little story about my contribution to Rolling Stones history. Just after Darryl came in and I was working with Don Smith, who'd done a lot of Keith's solo stuff with me and we were at Windmill Lane in Dublin and it was raining. Non-stop Irish rain, it wouldn't fucking stop and I was quitting smoking, so it was coffee, coffee, coffee and this song, which you are going to hear, it just wasn't fucking working. Keith is insisting no drums, you know? We're working away and I think, no, no, I go to Keith and I say, "Okay, so can Ronnie do a track on pedal steel?" He goes, "Yeah, but no drums." So I'm thinking "What the fuck!" So I give Mick castanets. So you've got Chuck Leavell on the harmonium and everyone is folding in all this beautiful shit, but this song is not taking off, so I say to Keith, "Do you trust me?" He goes yeah. "If I promise no drums, can we do a percussion track?" He says, "What's Charlie going to play?" And I'm thinking, "What is Charlie going to play?" But I'm asking myself what's the sound, something, not too crisp and I look over and I see in the corner... - Wait, what is it? - What is it? Wait, listen, what is it? It's not a drum. - What is it? - Listen, listen! What's that? She knows. Listen! - It's a trash can. - No! It's an aluminium fucking trash can. So I put Charlie out in the stairwell, we put a mic three floors up and Keith's shaking his head 'cause he knows I'm right. As soon as Charlie starts banging on it, we're off. A can for trash. Human evolution in the key of C. Yeah, all that and you still can't fucking move to it, you know. Okay, what else have we got? Aha! Okay, this is tops. - You produced this? - Christ, no. I was 16! This is tops. I didn't know it then, but I do now. Woo! Did he not cook for you when you were together? Marianne did, or it didn't happen. Her mother was mad for cooking. It runs in her family. Did you ever meet her finally, Paul? Yeah, last year in the hospital. Pen, she was a woman to know. I loved everything about her. I can't believe that the clock can just run out on a woman like that. Who is coming to the festival tonight? - What? - San Gaetano! Well, I can't, I, uh... - Why? - Why? It's one of the best nights in the year! Everybody will be out. Music horrible! Dancing horrible! Food horrible! You can't stay away! - And the police band is playing. - The police band? Fuck! Yes. They're not so bad you know. At least come for the fireworks. Mais no, mais no! There is no fireworks, cherie. I got to test some lenses before the weather breaks. - Come for the no fireworks! - Come! Will you come? Paul's got to score lenses. You go free! We can lend you the Mehari, so you can join us later. Oh, very kind of you! Hey, I just spoke to Robin. I'm on Kossakowski's shortlist for his documentary. No! You want to choose a dress for me? It's a bit plain. Very charming. Now, promise me, no talking tonight. Some are on the island now, hiding. Last year, one of the boats was spotted and the smugglers just threw everybody overboard to try to flee, whilst the coastguards did the rescues. But the goal, of course, is France. A lot of them have family there. - There you go, Tunisia. - Tunisia. Ah. You can smell the jasmine from here. Oh, guys it has already started. Try to behave, my angel! Yes! I was talking to my daughter, but you can be an angel, too. I'll be your angel. A drink without guilt. Now, frankly, it's sentimental to think you can help Paul by not drinking in front of him, or not talking about it for that matter. Come on, it was a year ago. I mean, if he can't even hear the subject mentioned, you don't have to go kicking over glasses and it's just ridiculous. And people talk about addiction, they talk about suicide. It happens. You know, I doubt he wanted to kill himself anyway. If you ask me, he wanted to kill the whole world, Marianne. Yeah, come on. I mean, we both know him. It's misdirection. That's what they call it. A case of psychic misdirection. Anyway, sorry. You both look great together. He takes very good care of you. No, I mean it. He does. You look fantastic. You both look amazing. Wonderful, wonderful to see you. And you know, this invalid thing, it suits you. Yeah, no it does, 'cause the roles are reversed and Paul can nurse you for a change. Oh, come on, I didn't mean it like that. Fuck. Okay! Okay! All right, all right, all right. Nice dress, nice dress! Of course. Yeah. I'll see you, yes? Bye, see you. You were my hero until just now. Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't stay away. You all right? She was just boring the life out of me is all. - You didn't look bored. - Yes, I know. Thank you. My trouble is that I fall in love with every pretty thing. That sounds paralysing. Try not to frighten the horses. I always loved you saying that. It was always funny to me, 'cause you always frightened the fucking horses. You, whereas with Paul... What's the point of Paul in your life now? I was angry with you. Yeah, I know I was slutting around, but you took everything so hard and now look what I've done. I've... thrown you this square. Yeah, he's square, Marianne. He's a square bear. He's all cuddly and built for hibernating with and he stuck. I will always be grateful to you for Paul. How are you dealing with this? Mm? What if it doesn't come back? You know, it might not come back. Have you thought about that? It's your fucking life! Your voice is your fucking life! Bet that you'll just reinvent yourself again, won't you? Is wearing your mother's clothes, is that reinvention? I don't think so. Anyway, I suppose you'll have your mummy phase and I have my daddy phase. But one way or another we're just going to grow old together, aren't we? I'm happy, Harry. Can't you stand that? Would you think I was being ingratiating if I said I wanted to make documentaries? Just pick up a camera and go film the kids in Mansoura or something. Oh, have you been there? - I wouldn't let that stop me. - Well, you want some advice? - Why? Because I'm a girl? - No. No, you should definitely go to Mansoura, or Detroit, whatever moves you. Just don't do it the Harry way. Just lay low, keep your mouth shut. You know, don't take a camera. Go empty-handed, seriously. You'll humiliate yourself any other way, trust me. I know everything about it. All right. I'm not afraid of that. Do you want some? - No. I don't smoke. - Doesn't mean you don't want some. Yes, it does. You must have been really desperate to crash your car like that. Excuse me? He said you were shot out of it, really far... and you didn't leave a note or anything. That's what he said? He thinks it's the most interesting thing you've done. He thinks you're too conceited to stand being addicted to anything. I'm guessing he's talking about drinking. Are you waiting for a reaction or something? Don't waste your time. ...And now let's play Pi?ata! Go right, go right... Go! Well done, Francesco! Well done! And next up is... Good evening! - Thanks for the table. - You're welcome! That's the guy who gave us the table. Come on! Let's perch over here. When did we last do this? How many years ago? When we were innocent babes. Come on! Come on! Oh, fuck, there's nobody here. Good evening. We don't have available tables. - What do you have? - Karaoke. Karaoke?! Oh, no, he says the screen is broken. Oh, fuck. Can I have a glass of sparkling water? Find something we'd be embarrassed to sing anywhere else. Come. Come here. Okay! Mm. Okay. Marianne! Marianne! Marianne! Marianne! Marianne! Marianne! Marianne! Marianne! Marianne! Woo! My daughter... Come on! Can I have her after you're finished with her, Daddy? Daddy! You're the best thing that ever happened to me. Marianne! Marianne! Marianne! Marianne! Marianne! Marianne! Marianne! Marianne! Marianne! - That was fantastic. - Oh. - Oh! - Good night, girls. Mireille! Good night. I told you I was going to drive the car. Now I'm going to. I'll keep my hand on the stick shift! Mm. Was it Mireille? Yeah. Hold on, give it to me. Let me... Mm. By the way, what's... Remember that woman he was with? Um... She was teaching at NYU. What's her name again? Yeah, Christie. They were swinging right? - What did you say? Dusty Christie? - Busty Christie. Yeah, she had huge melons! You remember? You remember they were swinging, right? Yeah. Now, what was it? Groups, men, college... Boys, college girls. What? He'd fuck everything. That's what I'm saying. Well, if you're talking about Penelope, I'll tell you that whatever's going on there, it's mutual and it's a great couple. Come on, look at them. Really! Come on. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. So, that makes all of us. He must just not know how it looks with Penelope. I think I should say something. Trust me. She can handle herself just fine. Which one of these do you prefer? Me, too. Well, that woman drives like a lunatic. You know that. But I was driving and she, she distracted me. - Are you hurt? - No, I'm fine. Listen, I think if it's both of us, then we can push it together. You need a tow truck. That's what you need. - Oh, Christ. Will you come or not? - A tow truck. They both tell me yes, but I don't think he really is. I mean, we don't even really look, or act very much alike at all. I'm going to ask him to take the test. There are reasons I'd like to know. Private reasons. - What the fuck happened? - I was going and coming at the same time. - Where's Mireille? - She went home to wash her mouth. How the hell do you want us to move that? Oh, well, let's hope it won't roll forward. I think, if we release the handbrake, we can put it back on to the road. All right, let's push it. - Careful. - Yeah. One, two, three. All right. Okay and again. All right, yeah, let's go. One, two, three. Fuck! This is not going to work. Forget about it. Jesus Christ! Too hot for white people. Fuck! You're pretty domesticated for a rock star. You were with Harry for what, six years? And you've been with Paul for how long? Cool. I heard that there used to be six songs on either side of a record album. You'd hear six and then you'd have to flip the thing over to hear more. You know what? I bet they put one really good song on each side, so you just keep flipping it over. By the way, have you seen my iPod? Because that sneaky Harry is always trying to get into it to see what I've been listening to. So you're working again. - Yeah, I'm shooting for hire nowadays. - Yeah? For a Russian master, Kossakovsky. You know him? - No. - Six-country shoot. - Uh-huh. - It keeps me busy for a while. When are you finishing yours? - Oh, you remember that? - Yeah of course. Lost Dog, American Journalism in the 21st Century. You showed me that amazing Cronkite interview. - Yeah. - Yeah, what? You're not giving that up too, are you? You shot all that footage. What is it, just lying in a drawer somewhere? No, actually it's in a closet. Five hard drives, but that can wait. Yeah, well, adjust your goals, not the world. Is that the same advice you'd give Pen? No! She's young. She should change the world any chance she gets. I think the women should change things now anyway. We've had our chance. Anyway, you will find your way back to it. You just got to get your finance, good editor, some guts. Just shut the fuck up, all right? Just stop talking and we'll be fine. Can you do that? Thanks a lot. I thought it was a good observation. It's the way you give it. It's not very careful. Well, it's how I care, isn't it? Honesty is the greatest fidelity. Yeah, well, the world is not ready for your honesty. I don't believe in half truths. Oh, you used to. Yeah, well, I learned my lesson then, didn't I? Not in time, but I learned it. I think going bust with Marianne was the great dumb tragedy of my great dumb life. It feels good to say it to you. You learned your lesson in time, though, didn't you? I mean, that's the important thing. Thank god for emergency rooms, eh? Hey! How did my beauties sleep? - My adorable ones! - Did you get the car out? No, we couldn't move it. We need Clara to tell us what to do I think. Whoa! Oh! Can I borrow the wheels? I want to see people. Pen, you want to come? What? Groceries? Okay, we'll go together. I need more treasure. Throw your watch in. - I'm reading. - Well, I need a shipwreck. Throw in a chair. I'm not going to throw in a chair. I'm sorry. Mister Paul! I'm finished. I'm going to the village. Okay, Clara. Shouldn't you be going round the island? Go check it out. It's pretty beautiful out here. I wouldn't know where to go. There's a lake pretty close by. A lot of kids come out, bring guitars, play music. It's fun. You should check it out. Show me. It's half day, market day and this wind is not sirocco! Fast first and then slow, one doesn't understand what it wants. It's weird... go while it isn't there. It's two miles from here. It's not so far. - Walking? - Yeah, it's a proper hike. You should be up for it. Okay. You want to see me do a handstand? Yeah, go ahead. The Allies bombed the hell out of this island. Maybe the market's up here, no? I think it is. Bit of a beaten up old town. I think it's down here. Yeah. It can look a bit full-on, a bit, you know, it could... In a situation like last night, it could be misconstrued. What do you mean? What do you mean, Marianne? What shit! I'm too brash. I'm too impulsive. I'm too a lot of things, but Christ, I'm sound. I mean, look, if you asked me, do I find my daughter sexy? Have I caught myself enjoying the sight of her? Yeah, I have. I didn't know her until a year ago, so yeah, it's a little odd. I acknowledge and I deal with the shit that goes on in my head. Coming from Paul, this would be outrageous. Paul is Paul, but coming from you, it's... I mean, what is the impulse here? To humiliate me or... What is it, really? Harry! This is not about us! Isn't it? We've been testing each other ever since I got off the plane. Well, I've never stopped, but... I mean, come on, it's me! Stop this lying to yourself. Listen! I am not going to leave Paul for you! Oh, what? You don't... What, you thought I was here for the capers? They used to process slaves on this island. Did you know that? I hate this fucking island. Look, let's not get things confused! I'm not fucking my daughter! Oh! So fucking predictable! Big enough audience? Are you kidding? We... We just made their vacation. Haven't we? I did leave a note. But anyway we tore it apart when I, uh... when I got out of the hospital. You and Marianne? Yeah. What did it say? Uh, just her name. I wanted to write it down one last time. I want you to see this! Giuseppe? Si. Good morning. - She's my friend, Marianne. - Come in. - Morning, Rosa. - Hello, how are you? My friend, Marianne. - Do you recognise her? - Yes. Please show us how you make ricotta. Civil Protection volunteers are ready to assist arriving migrants. First reception procedures have commenced... Come here. The ricotta will be coming up. Coming up, coming up. Within a few hours, a reception centre was set up. At 11:00 PM the fishing boat docks at the port. The migrants wave and thank rescue workers, thankful they've arrived safely. Even the children, held by their parents, wave hello. People who were desperate in their homeland... - Come and see the ricotta. - Taste it while it's warm. Marked by horrors of war, they hope for a better future... Medical exams confirm that only a few migrants need to be hospitalised... - Thank you. - You're welcome. Mm. - Good? - Very good! Okay. Mm. Okay? No, you... You don't need to apologise... ever. You never have. Well, they got to be here somewhere. They must've gone off for a hike or something. You do the ricotta? Here, be careful. Do it like this Turn it around... like that. Come on. This is you. It's in you. Let it out for me. Come on. Come on, this is happening. It's happening. Darling, no. He put a bell on your neck, right? I'm glad he did. - I can love you now. - No. Don't be angry. I love you. Then we shouldn't see each other anymore. In sixth grade, they offered an opera class at my school and I was hooked. La Momma Morta. "I'm love. I'm love." I had to conquer all things Italian after that. Ah. We were going to start without you. I'm sorry. We got kind of lost. Uh-huh. Parmigiano please, Pen. Thanks. So you two must be starving. You went swimming as well, no? - We did. - Where? At the lake? Um, no, actually, uh, Paul took us to the cliffs. Oh. We dived and dived and dived. How was the wind? I'll need a spoon to scrape the sand out of my eyes, that's for sure. Mm-hm. Well, you got your beach, then, more or less. It was better than a beach. Actually, there are a couple of beaches here, like micro beaches or something. I don't know what they call them. But really tiny, just for three or four people. It's beautiful. You can do anything you like out there really. If the wind dies down, that's what we do next. You'd love it. By the way, did Marianne make this? - Yeah. - This is so good, I can tell. Cilantro. That's her signature. She'll put it in anything. What? Will she? Yeah. By the way, they always say in Pantelleria, people eat a lot of capers, but so far we haven't eaten any, right? Oh, I have. Fucking gecko, shit! I think I'm going to go watch a movie or something. - Are you good? - Yeah, are you? Yeah, I'm just beat from the day. Pretty beat. Okay. Good night, Pen. Good night. I hope she didn't catch cold. She's just tired. It was a long day. Mm. Swimming... Swimming can take it out of you. How was your day? Any good? Pen? It's Harry. Come in. Sorry, um, it's just... You asked me to tell you when I was ready to go back and I'm ready. Okay. I've had my vacation. Did what you wanted to do? It was fantastic. I'll remember it always. Yeah, well, maybe go tomorrow. Good night. Night-night. I got your pills. I'm done with him. Aren't you? All the little snakes are sleeping. Mm. Oh, fuck! Are you waiting for me? Sh. That's a nice surprise. If you have something to say to me, say it. - Keep your voice down. - What, you think I'm plastered? Tonight's not the night for it. No, tonight is definitely the night for it. Paul, fuck! Seems you agree, eh? Why don't you do me a favour? Go to bed. Harry, listen. We need to talk. No, I need to pack. I need to wake Pen up. I need to be out of here by dawn. I don't particularly want to see you in the light of day. Yeah. I'll take a cab for the morning, so, uh, thanks for the use of your car, sir. Oh. Are we fighting? I'm sorry. - You're too much. Fuck. - Harry, come on. Why don't you go wake my daughter up, eh? You can tell her to pack and we'll get the fuck out of here right now. Did you fuck her or not? - Did you fuck her or not? - Did you fuck Marianne? It's not the same, man. - You know what the problem is? - You know what the problem is... is I gave you too much credit. We were friends. Better than brothers. Better than all those shits in their lofts talking about who the fuck cares what And now you just... you just tolerate me. Do you know how offensive that is to me? Think what you want, judge the hell out of me, but don't fucking tolerate me. - You don't deserve either of them. - Neither do you. You have no idea of the shit that I got her out of... off of. Well, I got her off you. What? I gave her to you. You're obscene. We're all obscene. Everyone's obscene. That's the whole fucking point. We see it and we love each other anyway. Love? I was wondering how long it would take you to pull that... You hit me. You hit me! All right, Paul. I don't know what I'm doing either. Here, help me out, will you? Yeah, come on, I'm sorr... Oh! What is this? Let go! Ah! Argh! Come on! Look at me. Look at me. Look at me! Harry, come on, come on, come on! Madam, madam... Mr Harry in the pool. Dead. Dead! Ah! No! Argh! Don't scream! Your voice, madam, you'll ruin your voice! Don't scream! Calm down... - Morning, Marshal. - Good morning. What are you doing? Don't touch it. Mister! Good morning, Marshal La Mattina. Hello, sir. What is that? Do you know? That thing... It's... It's an album. Emotional Rescue by the Rolling Stones. - What'd he say? - I didn't hear. It's music. Oh... vinyl? May I? Can I have some water please? There you go, sir. Are you OK, madam? So, Clara... first I need to know at what time Mr. Hawkes went swimming in the pool. What time Mr Harry... in the water? The bath. Splash, in the water. Well, he went out after dinner, around ten o'clock and we were asleep before he came back, so... Around 10:00. - No, no. - No, no, no! No dieci. After dieci. - After 10:00. - After 10:00... I see. And them? When did they go to sleep? Ask them. What time, uh, you... In the bed. 12:00. And...? You too? And the gentleman? Um, around 1:30. And then I took a sleeping pill. - He took drugs. - You took drugs?! Drugs? No, of course not. It... Jesus, it's a medicine, all right, to go to sleep. Ah! - Pills to sleep. - To sleep, OK. Listen, I'm wasting too much time! I have 30 people to question. What can we do? It's not their fault, poor things. Tell them to come to the police station at 2:00. And I will find a suitable translator. Oh! He says, uh, station carabinieri, two! At 2:00. All three of them. And wear shoes! Let's go, guys. IDs please? Passport. Thank you. We put them all here in an enclosure, but it's inhumane, it's shameful. School isn't in session, can't we put them there? There's 12 of them, got it? They're human beings, theoretically. Mister. Here we are. Paul De Smedt. Morning. You can speak English or French. Take a seat. Are you hurt? Of course. I'll be sad forever. No, I'm... Yesterday... Paul, he has a wound. Did you see it? Yeah. Here. On the side. Do you understand me? Don't talk! Maybe you didn't understand, I'm not asking for a favour, the fridge in Kamma is broken. Tell Giuppy to take out all the meat, the corpse will go bad in this heat. Show some respect. You're talking about my father. Is it too much to ask? You're right miss, sorry. I'll call you back. 10 more minutes. Madam, would you follow me, please? Have a seat. We know you recovering from surgery and it's not easy for you to talk. Turn off this phone, it's been ringing for an hour! How long you and Mr De Smedt friend? You were awake... You were awake last night? Mario, give me a hand looking for the IDs, or the Marshal will be pissed! Will he? Does he know where to look in this mess here? The sand at the bottom of the pool... ...showed movement. As if several people were in the water... Or maybe only two. Two moving around a lot. Or maybe fighting. Oh! If you are talking about charging Paul De Smedt, I need to call my lawyers. No, no, don't worry. What a beautiful bag... Beautiful... Maresciallo will found out what happened. He must take care of other drownings. Yesterday, seven immigrants died in the sea. Survivors are deported to detention centres in the mainland. Immigrants in Lampedusa are more than locals now. It's a tragedy. It start here, but go far. When did you find them? 12:00, yesterday. And seven drowned in sea. There is a path. To the house. It comes up behind the pool. You saw it. And anybody could... ...come up there, when Mr Hawkes was swimming and... ...we would never have heard them. She's thinking of the refugees. He will ask them. They cannot be more offended more than they already are. Poor things... Ah, the girl. You and Mr De Smedt have to stay here now, but the girl, she can travel if she want. But she need her mother to sign the letter, because minors cannot travel without consent of the parents. She's underage, madam. She's 17. Paul! Paul! I tried to save him. I tried, I tried, I tried. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah? Hi, It's me. Huge fucking crowd out of there. They're turning people away. So, Derrick tells me that Worried About You is off the set list. - Is that true? - Mm-hm. Oh, for Christ's sake. - Harry, don't ask me to do... - I'm not asking. ...sentimental things for you, anymore. It's not fair on Paul. Stop that, would you? Just stop it. - Yeah. - Marianne, it's time. Okay. It's not about fucking Paul. You know that. Come on. Why are you resisting me? It's done. Don't let it upset you. Marianne! Marianne! Well, do you want me to let you know if there's some kind of service for friends or something? Why did you lie to us? I didn't lie. You're not 22, you're 17. Christ, you're still in high school. You speak Italian. Yeah, yeah. And you sat there over and over with people... struggling to communicate with one another. You like to watch people having a hard time. Is that it? Is that the kind of woman you want to be? I would just rather be left alone. It's different. No! That's not different. I wasn't your enemy. None of us was. Don't let it upset you, okay? Mm. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. On behalf of our Alitalia crew, we'd like to welcome you aboard this flight to Rome Fiumicino. Loading operations are being completed and we'll be ready to leave shortly. The flying time will be approximately one hour and ten minutes. Weather-wise, whilst it's raining here in Pantelleria, the forecast for Rome is bright and sunny with a temperature of about 30 degrees Celsius. We thank you for flying with us. Madam! Madam! Ms. Lane, excuse me! I need to tell you something. Mario! Go away! Madam... Can you write your name, madam? My name? Your name, there? Write it? Okay. Your name. Carmelo. Carmelo, madam. Thanks, madam! You are fantastic. You are fantastic. This is mine alone. From you... to me. Mine alone, madam. Okay, I got to go. Yes, yes... Madam... You very nice people. You go home now. He's a fan. A fan.
