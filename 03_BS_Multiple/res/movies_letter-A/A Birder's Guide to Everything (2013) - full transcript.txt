GET OUT OF HERE. TIMMY, TIMMY, I WANT YOU SO BAD. I WANT YOU IN MY PANTS, TIMMY. SHHH. YOUNG BIRDERS SOCIETY ALL PRESENT. MR. SECRETARY, PLEASE READ THE MINUTES. UM, WHERE'S-WHERE'S CAROLINE? SHE'S NO LONGER A MEMBER. WHY? MOSTLY BECAUSE HER HEART WASN'T IN BIRDING. IS THAT A PROBLEM, ROB? UH, YEAH... WELL, I JUST WANTED TO BE IN A CLUB GET OUT. WHAT? THIS ISN'T A DATING SERVICE. JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. I WON'T MISS THIS. ALRIGHT, SO NOW THAT WE'RE DOWN TO THREE, I DON'T THINK WE'RE TECHNICALLY A CLUB ANYMORE BY SCHOOL RULES. LET'S JUST GET ON WITH THE MEETING. YOUNG BIRDERS SOCIETY ALL PRESENT. MR. SECRETARY, PLEASE READ THE MINUTES. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. I HEREBY SUBMIT THE MINUTES FROM THE MEETING DATED 4TH OF MARCH. IN NEW BUSINESS, PETER NESSBAUMB WAS AWARDED A GOLDEN FEATHER BY UNANIMOUS VOTE FOR SIGHTING THE LONG-TAILED JAEGER. MY PROPOSITION TO INVESTIGATE THE PURCHASE OF A HANG GLIDER WAS DEFEATED FOUR TO ONE DESPITE IT BEING AN AWESOME IDEA. FINALLY CAROLINE HALPERN THREATENED TO QUIT YBS IF I DIDN'T STOP CALLING HER TUFTED TITMOUSE, AND UM WELL SHE ENDED UP QUITTING. MR. CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MR. BARSKY. MR. CHAIRMAN? MR. PORTNOY? I MOVE TO POSTPONE OFFICER REPORTS, COMMITTEE REPORTS, AND SPECIAL ORDERS AND PROCEED DIRECTLY TO NEW BUSINESS. ALL FOR IT? YAY. ALL OPPOSED? NAH. THE MOTION PASSES TWO VOTES TO ONE. IS THERE ANY NEW BUSINESS? UH, MR. CHAIRMAN? THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES DAVID PORTNOY. I SPOTTED THIS ON THE STREET THIS MORNING. I GOT A WEIRD FEELING ABOUT IT. IT LOOKS LIKE AN ECLIPSE PLUMAGE WHITE-WING SCOTER. NUH HUH, LOOK AT THE WAY THE NAPE A MOVE TO MARK THE IMAGE AS INCLUSIVE AND CARRY ON WITH THE MEETING. MOVE TO FIND THE BIRD AGAIN. THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES HIMSELF. MR. PORTNOY, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME YOU BROUGHT SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO THE COMMITTEE. FOR REFERENCE, I SET THE ALLEGED SUNGRY LAST SUMMER. I DIDN'T HAVE A PICTURE. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THERE'S A CREDIBILITY GAP HERE. MR. BARSKY? WHILE I APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT OF DAVID'S PROPOSAL, A RARE BIRD SIGHTING CERTAINLY COULD REVERSE SINKING MEMBERSHIP BUT IN MY OPINION, I THINK WE SHOULD STICK TO MORE AGGRESSIVE RECRUITMENT STRATEGIES. LIKE GETTING A HANG GLIDER. THANK YOU. THAT'S ALL MR. CHAIRMAN. - ALL FOR FINDING DAVID'S DUCK? - YAY. - ALL OPPOSED? - NAY. THE MOTION'S DEFEATED BY A VOTE OF TWO TO ONE. DAMNIT. DAVE? DAVE, IS THAT YOU? COME UP HERE. - HEY. - HI. SO I GOT EVERYTHING KIND OF SORTED OUT INTO THREE MAIN GROUPS. SAVE, THROW, CHARITY. YOU GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR LIP. WHAT'S THAT? NOTHING. A PEN EXPLODED. WAIT, ARE YOU KIDDING? WELL I THOUGHT I'D SAVE THE GOOD ONES. MOM WORKED REALLY HARD FOR ALL OF THESE. OK, WELL, YEAH... I MEAN, OF COURSE YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING. OF COURSE WE'LL KEEP THEM. WHAT'S THIS? BLENDER? OH YOU KNOW WHAT? JULIANA'S GOT A REALLY NICE BLENDER. I WAS THINKING WE'D JUST GIVE THAT ONE TO TED. YEAH, I'D RATHER WE GAVE JULIANA'S TO TED. SURE. LISTEN, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'll TELL YOU WHAT. YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO MEET THIS STRING QUARTET IN LIKE LITERALLY... TEN MINUTES. SO WHY DON'T YOU DO THIS? TAKE THESE, MARK WHAT YOU WANT TO KEEP. THE REST WE'LL EITHER CHUCK OR WE'LL GIVE TO GOODWILL. ALRIGHT? OK? PROBLEM SOLVED? FINE. YEAH? SEE YA. YOU'RE THE CAMERA GUY NOW, HUH? YEAH. OK, YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BIRDS, NOT MOM. BIRDS. BIRDS, NOT ME. WHERE THE HELL IS DAVID? HE'S RIGHT THERE. NOT COOL, MAN. SORRY. WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN? WE'RE IN CRISIS MODE HERE. I'M SORRY. I THINK I MAY HAVE FOUND OH WOW, OK, SO I CHECKED EVERY SCAUR, SCOTER, EIDER, INCLUDING THE PALEARCTIC, NEOTROPICAL OPTIONS. NONE OF THEM ARE A MATCH. THIS AGAIN? DID YOU EVEN SLEEP? OK. SO THEN I THOUGHT MAYBE IT'S RARER THAN THOSE. WELL THE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED DUCKS CONSIST OF THE WEST INDIAN WHISTLING, THE LAYSAN, AND THE WHITE-HEADED DUCK. BUT IT'S NOT ANY OF THOSE. SO WHAT'S RARER THAN CRITICALLY ENDANGERED? I MEAN NOTHING. AFTER CRITICALLY ENDANGERED IT GOES EXTINCT. EXACTLY. OH MY GOD. AH DAMNIT. CAMPTORHYNCHUS LABRADORIUS. AH, THIS WOULD BE SO HUGE. IF EVELYN REED KNEW I REDISCOVERED AN EXTINCT DUCK, SHE'D DEFINITELY LET ME DO IT. POSSIBLY DOGGIE STYLE. IT'S CALLED RETROCOPULATION, MAN. THE TERM DOGGIE STYLE IS OFFENSIVE TO WOMEN AND POSSIBLY DOGS AS WELL. YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT. GUYS, YOU'RE BOTH MISSING THE POINT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YEAH, I MEAN IT HAS TO BE A FEMALE, NOT A MALE. OOH THE WING MARKS CONCERN ME, BUT TO BE FAIR, WING MARKS ALWAYS CONCERN ME. B TEAMS HOW DOES THAT WORK? OK, WE NEED TO FIND THIS DUCK AGAIN. OH WHAT WE NEED IS AN EXPERT OPINION. WELL, UH, I CAN GET US A MEETING WITH LAWRENCE CONRAD. JUST BECAUSE HE SAID YOU HAD NICE STYLE AT A BOOK SIGNING. UM, HE SAID I HAD INTERESTING STYLE, AND YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHY. DICK. HELLO? HE'S TOO BUSY. I TOLD YOU THIS. HELLO? WHAT? OH SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING. MY SECRETARY'S AT LUNCH AND THIS THING SHOULD HAVE THERE YOU GO, ANYONE? UH, YELLOW WARBLER. BRAVO. DO COME IN. NOPE. NO, NO. THAT'S ALL WRONG. YEAH WELL, IT DOES DECLINE AT THE NAPE. WHICH ONE OF YOU SAW IT? UH, I DID. I'M SORRY THE PICTURE'S SO BLURRY. I WAS ON MY BIKE WHEN I SPOTTED IT. ON YOUR BIKE? THAT'S MARVELOUS. THAT'S THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS FIELD. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE A HIGH SCHOOL KID ON YOUR BIKE, OR AN OLD EGG HEAD LIKE ME WITH A BOAT LOAD OF SILLY DEGREES. ABSOLUTELY ANYONE CAN BE A BIRDER. EXCEPT FOR BLIND PEOPLE I SPOSE. SO YOU THINK IT COULD ACTUALLY BE A RARE CLOSE THE DOOR, PLEASE. ANY OF YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE TERM LAZARUS SPECIES? YOU, GLASSES. AN ORGANISM REDISCOVERED ALIVE AFTER HAVING BEEN CONSIDERED EXTINCT. AND WHILE LAZARUS SPECIES ARE VERY RARE, HERE IN AMERICA, I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF BEING AMONGST THOSE WHO REFOUND THE IVORY BILLED WOODPECKER IN 2005, THOUGH CERTAIN SCIENTISTS DO DISPUTE MY CLAIM. FOOLS. FEBRUARY 20TH, 2005. I REMEMBER BECAUSE IT WAS THREE WEEKS AFTER MY LIFE MAGELLANIC WOODPECKER IN CHILE, QUITE A MONTH FOR CAMPEPHILUS. YOU REMEMBER ALL THE DATES ON YOUR LIFE LIST? NOW... ON MAY 13TH OF THIS YEAR, WE MIGHT I DO STRESS "MIGHT" HAVE SPOTTED YES. CAMPTORHYNCHUS LABRODORIOUS. MMHMM. THE FIRST BIRD TO GO EXTINCT IN NORTH AMERICA. NO ONE HAS SEEN ONE OF THESE FELLAS SINCE 1878. SO DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT DAVID SAW A LABRADOR DUCK? OF COURSE THE PHOTO'S TOO BLURRY TO PROVE ANYTHING. AND CERTAINLY OUT OF CONSIDERATION FOR PUBLICATION. TRUST ME WHAT BIRDERS DO NOT NEED IS MORE CONTROVERSY. NO, I THINK THE ONLY THING TO DO HERE IS TO FIND THE BIRD AGAIN. WELL IT'S PROBABLY MIGRATING. IT COULD BE ANYWHERE. WHICH MEANS YOU NEED TO GET A MOVE ON. THE LABRADOR IS CLOSELY RELATED TO SEA DUCKS. SUCH AS EIDERS. IT'S PROBABLY HEADING NORTH, MAYBE EVEN MIGRATING WITH SCOTERS. NOW THE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU, IS THAT IT'LL BE ATTRACTED TO THE LARGEST INLAND BODIES OF WATER BEFORE IT HITS THE COAST. NOW MY GUESS IS, IT'LL BE IN SOUTHERN CONNECTICUT BY SUN FALL TOMORROW. SO YOU THINK IT'S ACTUALLY POSSIBLE TO FIND IT AGAIN? I DO. BUT I MUST WARN YOU, I LOVE THE CHASE. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'VE READ MY MEMOIR. "LOOK TO THE SKIES," I'VE READ IT FIVE TIMES. THEN I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THAT I SPENT 15 MONTHS IN ECUADOR TRACKING THE PALE-HEADED BRUSH FINCH ONLY TO LEARN THAT IT WAS A MERE WHITE-HEADED BRUSH FINCH. IF I'D FACED FACTS A FEW DAYS EARLIER, YOU'D BE LOOKING AT A MAN WITH TWO LEGS. I WON'T DENY IT, I'M STARTING TO GET VERY JEALOUS OF YOU LADS. WE HAVE, UM, MODERN EUROPEAN HISTORY CLASS IN 25 MINUTES. FAIR ENOUGH. WELL DO KEEP ME INFORMED. NEVER HESITATE TO CALL. OH, AND ONE PIECE OF ADVICE FROM AN OLD TWITCHER, GET YOURSELVES A BETTER CAMERA. ONE WITH A SMALL TELEPHOTO LENS. YEAH, I CAN DEFINITELY DO THAT. EXCELLENT. HAVING THE WRONG GEAR IS PRECISELY WHY THIS PHOTO IS ULTIMATELY USELESS. GOOD LUCK, GENTLEMAN. DR. CONRAD. DR. CONRAD? COULD YOU, UM, SIGN MY BOOK? FIRST EDITION. YEAH. PORTNOY. WAS YOUR MOTHER DOROTHY PORTNOY? YOU KNOW MY MOTHER? OF COURSE. BACK IN THE 80S AND 90S, SHE HELPED PIONEER THE USE OF MARINE RADAR TO PREDICT MIGRATANT FALL OUT. SHE WAS A REAL UNSUNG HERO OF BIRDING. THAT MUST HAVE BEEN AWFUL. I'M DEEPLY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. WHY? IT'S WAY TOO INTENSE. I MEAN, I'M SORRY BUT THIS WOULD AN OFFICIAL YBS MEETING. OK, MOVE TO DISCUSS. UM, SECOND. ALRIGHT, THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES TIMOTHY BARSKY. THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN, MR. PORTNQY, SIMPLY PUT, WE MUST FIND THIS BIRD. I THINK IT COULD REPRESENT A NEW HOPE FOR YBS, WHICH FRANKLY IS ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE. I THINK WITH THE RIGHT PUBLICITY, SIGHTING OF THE LABRADOR DUCK COULD BOOST MEMBERSHIP, AND THE THREE OF US COULD REAP UNTOLD REWARDS. FAME-WISE, MONEY-WISE, AND VAGINA-WISE. THANK YOU. THAT'S ALL, MR. CHAIRMAN. I CONCUR. MOVE TO VOTE. SECOND. ALL IN FAVOR OF SEARCHING FOR THE EXTINCT LABRADOR DUCK? YAY. ALL OPPOSED. NAY. MOTION PASSES TWO TO ONE. I'll DROP THE BUDGET. YOU DON'T HAVE TO. I WANT TO. YEAH? HEY, UH... I LEFT SOMETHING IN THE LAB YESTERDAY. OH, OK. I'M ELLEN, BY THE WAY. WHAT? WE'RE IN A CLASS TOGETHER, SO I'M TELLING YOU WHO I AM. OH. HI. HI, THERE YOU GO. ALRIGHT, SO GIVEN THE EXPECTED SPEED OF THE LABRADOR DUCK, IN ITS PRESUMED TRAJECTORY, THE BIRD WILL BE FORCED TO REST IN ITS FIFTEEN MILE RADIUS ENCOMPASSING CEDAR LAKE OR COCKAPONSET. OK, WELL I'M PUTTING MY MONEY ON COCKAPONSET. AND NOT JUST BECAUSE IT HAS THE WORD COCK IN IT. WELL, I STILL MAINTAIN IT'S A LONGSHOT AT BEST, BUT AS PLACES GO, YOU KNOW? IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN MOST. OH, ON THE TRANSPORTATION FRONT, MY COUSIN ERIC SAID HE'D LOAN ME SOME WHEELS. HE DID? YEAH. HE'S A COOL GUY. HE LIKES ME A LOT. HEY, ISN'T YOUR DAD GETTING MARRIED THIS WEEKEND? YEP. THIS IS WAY MORE IMPORTANT. DAVID? YEAH. DAVID. OH HI BOYS. HELLO MRS. SANTOS. JULIANA! OW. DAVID, THERE IS SOMEBODY HERE TO SEE YOU. A GIRL FROM YOUR SCHOOL, I THINK. GO ON IN, HON. THANK YOU. YOU STOLE YOU THE LENS. PREPOSTEROUS. WHAT'S PROJECT ANUS? ANAS, OK? AND IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. JUST GIVE ME THE LENS. AND WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE OF THIS ALLEGED THEFT OF THIS ALLEGED LENS? WELL, IT WAS THERE EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON. I GAVE HIM THE KEYS, HE WENT INTO THE LAB, AND THEN IT WAS GONE. CIRCUMSTANTIAL. IT'S SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU. OH DAMNIT, PETER. OH MY GOD. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A LABRADOR DUCK? I STILL DON'T GET WHY IT'S CALLED PROJECT ANUS. ANAS. IT'S LATIN FOR DUCK. YOU GUYS SPEAK LATIN? YEAH, SOMETIMES. YOU SHOULD COME WITH US. THIS WOULD SERIOUSLY WOULD BE THE FIRST PHOTO OF THIS EXTINCT DUCK? YEAH. DEFINITELY. IF I COME I'M TAKING THE PICTURE. NO, YOU'RE NOT. OK, THAT'S NOT A POSSIBILITY. TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. WE'LL TAKE IT. WHEN DO WE LEAVE? ♪ AM FROM TIMMY'S COUSIN'S HOUSE. 25 SOUTH RIDGE DRIVE. COOL. WHERE THE HELL DID THAT COME FROM? SHE MADE ME NERVOUS, OK? OK, WELL ON THE FLIP SIDE, ONE OR POSSIBLY MORE OF US WILL GET SOME ACTION THIS WEEKEND. MOST LIKELY BEING ME. NOPE, NOT GONNA HAPPEN. HEY, NEED SOME HELP? I GOT IT. WHERE YOU GOING? TIMMY'S. SLEEPING OVER TONIGHT. YOU KNOW, I'M GETTING MARRIED. TOMORROW. I'll BE BACK IN PLENTY OF TIME. C'MON DAD, IT'S IMPORTANT. I GOTTA GO. ALRIGHT. OK, OK. I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED TO GIVE YOU YOUR GRIEVING SPACE. DON'T DR. SCHULTZ IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, THE REHEARSAL IS AT 10 AM. THE REHEARSAL? YEAH. IT'S WALKING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE LAWN TO THE OTHER, RIGHT? OK, C'MON. TIME OUT. I KNOW, I KNOW. I GET THAT IT'S ALL GOTTA SEEM PRETTY WEIRD TO YOU, AND MAYBE JULIANA'S NOT YOUR FAVORITE PERSON IN THE WORLD DAD, I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW. FAST FORWARD TEN YEARS FROM NOW, SHE'S GONNA REALLY CARE, SHE'S GONNA BE A REALLY COOL, KICKASS MOM.I MEAN, YOU GOTTA LOOK AT THINGS, LIKE... EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON WHAT? FOR A REASON? YOU KNOW, I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. THAT'S NOT-THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT TO SAY. WHAT I MEANT BULLSHIT. C'MON, DAVID. YOU ARE TOO FAST. I GOTCHYA. SORRY, I'M LATE. HAVE WE CONFIRMED HE KNOWS WE'RE COMING? YES. ERIC? TIMMY. MY MAN. ERIC. MY MAN. UM, DO YOU THINK WE COULD GRAB THOSE KEYS NOW? OH YEAH, KEYS. TOTALLY. COULD YOU GO GET THEM NOW? SURE.

FOR LIKE SEVERAL REASONS. THERE ARE INSURANCE ISSUES THAT WOULD NOT BE EASY TO RESOLVE, TO SAY THE LEAST. I HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT YOU OR ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE SAFE AND/OR RELIABLE DRIVERS. NOT TO MENTION, TRISH AND I HAVE PLANS TO USE THE CAR TO GO UP TO SHEEP'S MEADOW TO HANG OUT AND SMOKE WEED. WELL HE DOES MAKE SOME CONVINCING ARGUMENTS. THANK YOU. FINE, WELL THANKS ANYWAY, ERIC.

TIMMY. IT'S GO TIME. WAIT, WAIT, YOUR PLAN IS TO KNIFE THEM? JUST PUT AWAY THE KNIFE TIMMY. IT'S YOUR FUNERAL. WOAH. NICE OUTFITS. HOW WE DOING? ANY LUCK FINDING THE LABRADOR? WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING US? WE'RE ACTUALLY FOLLOWING OUR GUIDE. WHO'S YOUR GUIDE? GENTLEMEN. BIRDING ON AN ATV. SEEMS LIKE AN OXYMORON, BUT IT GETS THE JOB DONE. YOU KNOW? EVER SINCE YOU BOYS LEFT MY OFFICE, I'VE BEEN KICKING MYSELF. HOW COULD I, A NOTED VETERAN OF THE FIELD, ENTRUST WHAT IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST ORNITHILOGICAL FIND OF THE CENTURY, TO, NO OFFENSE NOW, AMATEURS. LATELY I'VE BEEN SPENDING A BIT OF TIME GUIDING THESE GENTLEMEN HERE, AND I JUST THOUGHT THE MORE CHAPS HELPING OUT YEAH, WE DON'T NEED YOUR HELP. WELL I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HERE IS FINDING THE BIRD. WE'RE SIMPLY DOUBLING THE SIZE OF OUR SEARCH PARTY. JUST A FEW YEARS AGO, EVEN WITH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE COMBING THE ARKANSAS BAYOU, WE STILL COULDN'T PROVE OUR CLAIM. YEAH, WE KNOW. THE IVORY-BILLED WOODPECKER. WE'RE FANS. YOU'RE TRYING TO POACH OUR SIGHTING. WHO'S THE NEW GIRL? HER NAME'S ELLEN. GUYS, I'M SORRY. CAN WE TAKE A SECOND? OF COURSE. SORRY. SO YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET A SHARED SIGHTING CREDIT, RIGHT? OH, CERTAINLY. I'M SORRY I SHOULD HAVE PREFACED ALL THIS BY SAYING IT'S FINE. WE THINK WE SAW SOMETHING FLYING SOUTH A FEW HOURS AGO HEADING TOWARDS CROSS LAKE I THINK WE SHOULD STICK WITH CEDAR. IT'S THE MOST OBVIOUS CHOICE. OF COURSE. WE CAN SPLIT UR, AND WE'LL GO TO CEDAR AND YOU GUYS CAN GO TO THE RIVER. A SEA DUCK RESTING ON A RIVER. HAVE YOU EVEN BEEN BIRDING BEFORE? OH REALLY? IT'S JUST WHAT I SAW. PETER? HEY! PETER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? NO, NO, NO. HEY! HEY! GET OFF OF IT. ARE YOU CRAZY? GO, GO, GO. HOLY SHIT. THRILLING. SO WHAT NOW? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I DON'T KNOW, I MEAN PETER JUST STOLE YOUR FRIENDS' ATV AND YOU'RE TRYING TO STEAL OUR SIGHTING. JUST THAT. THAT'S ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT. ANOTHER WAY IS THAT WE ARE FOUR BIRDERS LOOKING TO FIND AN EXTINCT DUCK, STANDING ON THE BRINK OF HISTORY. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STEAL THE CREDIT FOR THE SIGHTING. ARE WE COOL? YES. MIGUEL FORGOT A TIE. DO YOU HAVE ONE? HE'S NOT GOING TO WANT ONE OF MY TIES. LET ME SEE WHAT DAVID HAS. DON, I'M GONNA NEED THE LIST FOR THE WHAT THE HELL IS ALL THIS? I THINK I MIGHT BE AN ASSHOLE, TED. IT'S RARE I GO BIRDING WITH A YOUNGER GENERATION. I HAD HOPED THAT MY DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED IN MY FOOTSTEPS, BUT SHE AND MY EX-WIFE DETEST ME. DID YOU AND YOUR MOTHER BIRD TOGETHER? YES. A LOT. SHE WOULD OF ADORED THIS. YOU PROBABLY DON'T REMEMBER, BUT BACK IN THE 90S, SHE DISCOVERED A NEW COLONY OF PIPING PLOVERS I HAVE ALL THE NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS. THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE FEELING OF DISCOVERY. HOW'S YOUR FATHER DOING? IT MUST BE DIFFICULT FOR THE TWO OF YOU NOW. HE'S UM, HE'S GETTING MARRIED. I SEE. WELL EVERYONE COPES DIFFERENTLY. AND SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST DICKS. YOUR FATHER'S NOT A DICK. I'M SORRY, YOU DON'T KNOW HIM. WELL I DO ACTUALLY. HE HELPED WITH ARCHIVING DOTTIE'S RESEARCH MATERIALS AT THE MAGAZINE AFTER SHE DIED. WHAT? WAIT, HOW? HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? BIRDS ARE MY MUSES. AND I STRIVE TO BE A TRUE WATCHER. I CAN REMEMBER WHEN I SPOTTED MY FIRST GREATER PRAIRIE CHICKEN, BUT NOT MY OWN DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY. BUT YOU'RE ALREADY I'M SIXTY-THREE YEARS OLD AND VERY MUCH ALONE. I GUIDE ASSHOLES FOR MONEY. I HAVE ONE LEG AND NO DRIVER'S LICENSE. PLEASE DO NOT CONFUSE ME WITH A ROLE MODEL. WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE? OH, BIT OF A MIX UP BETWEEN WHAT I THOUGHT WAS AN ALBINO NIGHT HAWK AND A HIGH SPEED POLICE CHASE. OK, KEEP LOOKING. KEEP LOOKING. SEE IF YOU SEE IT. REMARKABLE. IT'S EMPTY THOUGH. HERE GOES NOTHING. WAS THAT IT? MAYBE. IT WAS A LITTLE MUFFLED. IT WAS DEFINITELY A GREETING CALL. I THINK THAT MAYBE IT WAS OH MY GOD! THAT WOULD BE A MALE MALLARD. OH. WAIT, BUT WHY WOULD IT ANSWER TO A SCOTER CALL? MAYBE IT WAS RAISED BY SCOTERS. IT WAS NOT RAISED BY SCOTERS, OK? YA KNOW? CROSS LAKE IS A FEW MILES UP. I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST GO THERE. WHY WOULD WE GO TO THE LAKE THAT'S FARTHER FROM SHORE? IT'S NOT UNHEARD OF. YEAH, IT'S PRACTICALLY UNHEARD OF. GUYS? IS THAT YOUR DUCK, DAVID? OH MY GOD. WHAT'S IT DOING? SHH. IT'S PREENING.

YEP, IT'S DEFINITELY AN ODD HYBRID OF SORTS. JUST SHUT UP, JEFF. IF IT'S OK WITH YOU GUYS, WE'D LIKE TO TAKE THE DUCK FOR OUR BANQUET. BANQUET? WE'RE HUNTING FOR OUR CHURCH BANQUET. ALL THE PROCEEDS ARE GOING TO THE SAVE DARFUR FOUNDATION. WELL, THAT'S A BIT OF A SILVER LINING. DAVID, IT'S DAVID, IT WAS JUST A HYBRID MALLARD. HE LOOKED AT ME. HE DIDN'T HAVE TO SUFFER. I KNOW. WHY'D SHE HAVE TO DIE? I DON'T KNOW WHY. YOU KNOW, IN INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, THE BAD GUY THAT GOES AROUND, AND HE RIPS THE HEART OUT OF PEOPLE, AND HE HOLDS IT UP IN FRONT OF THEIR FACE SO THEY WATCH IT BEAT. YEAH, I HATE THAT PART. I... I DON'T SEE HOW IT'LL EVER STOP HURTING. WELL, UM, MAYBE ONE DAY IT'LL FEEL LESS AWFUL THAN RIPPING AN ORGAN OUT OF YOUR CHEST PAIN? BUT MY GUESS IS IT WILL ALWAYS HURT. YEAH. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. WHAT-WHAT TIME IS IT? I DON'T KNOW. I THINK MY PHONE DIED LIKE THREE HOURS AGO WILL WE MAKE IT BACK FOR THE WEDDING? I MEAN, WE DON'T HAVE A CAR.

THAT IS WHAT YOU GET. DAD. YEAH? WERE YOU SEEING JULIANA BEFORE OR AFTER MOM? DEFINITELY AFTER. OK. YOUR MOTHER WAS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE. YOU KNOW THAT. NO, I DIDN'T. AH JESUS CHRIST. DAVID, I'M SORRY I SHOULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING IT ALL. WE SPOKE ABOUT IT. NO WE DIDN'T. WE DIDN'T SPEAK ABOUT IT. NOT REALLY. WE DIDN'T. YOU KNOW, IT'S IT'S LIKE YOU REMEMBER THAT I JUST DON'T' WANT TO PRETEND THAT WE DON'T MISS MOM. ME EITHER. WANNA GRAB THAT CHICKEN? BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT WE WERE TERRORISTS. IT WAS AWFUL. HEY. EXCUSE ME. ARE YOU IN A BAND OR SOMETHING? EXCUSE ME? HELLO? HEY. HEY, EVERYONE. UM SO TECHNICALLY I'M THE BEST MAN HERE, AND I GUESS I'M SUPPOSED TO GIVE A TOAST. UM WHERE DO I START? THE THING IS THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR AN EXTINCT DUCK. NO, IT'S NOT LIKE A METAPHOR OR SOMETHING. IT TURNS OUT IT WASN'T EXTINCT. ACTUALLY IT WASN'T THE DUCK I THOUGHT IT WAS. AND IT GOT SHOT. BUT IN A WEIRD WAY IT TURNS OUT IT MIGHT HELP THE WHOLE SITUATION GOING ON IN DARFUR. SORRY, ANYWAY I'M GLAD I MADE IT HERE. TODAY. ALTHOUGH THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN KINDA ROUGH FOR OUR FAMILY. UM DAVID? I KNOW, SORRY. DAD LIKES TO FILL HOLES WITH LISTS. THAT'S WHAT HE DOES. HE WRITES LISTS OF EVERYTHING. LIKE LISTS OF LISTS. AND I LIKE TO FIND RARE BIRDS, SO I'M NOT REALLY ONE TALK. BUT IT DOESN'T DOESN'T REALLY WORK, WHICH IS WHY I AM SO GLAD HE FOUND JULIANA. BECAUSE I KNOW MY MOM REALLY LIKED HER AND MY DAD OBVIOUSLY LIKES HER TOO. THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL HERE RIGHT. SO I WISH THEM A HAPPY AND LONG LIFE TOGETHER. HERE'S TO DAD AND JULIANA. YOU WERE PERFECT. SO, DOES ERIC KNOW THAT WE, LIKE, DESTROYED HIS ENGINE? AH YOU KNOW THE TIMING'S NOT QUITE RIGHT. HE'S NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY.
