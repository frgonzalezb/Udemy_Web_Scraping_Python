The fire was started by a local... He has already confessed... - Is it true he was a teacher? - Yes, retired. The fire is already threatening homes... ...near the elementary school. The flames were 30 meters high. It spread to our house in no time. It's dreadful. Who would do something like that? Sociology. - The Human Rights... - Oh, not again! - Repeat after me. - The Human Rights... - Do you remember them? - Yes, I do! - Get on with it! - Cut it out! - My exam is in a month! - I don't care. Repeat after me! One. "All men are born equal." "All men are born equal." Two. "They are gifted with reason and conscience." This doesn't apply in your case! Gifted with reason and conscience. This doesn't apply in your case! "And it's their duty", I say! "To act in a spirit of brotherhood." "To act in a spirit of... whatever!" "Everyone, Gogo, my child... "...has the right to life..." ...to freedom and security of person." - "Every man..." - "Everyone!" "To freedom..." "...and security of person." "Every person has the right to move freely." "And to choose the place he wants to live in." Everyone, except you. You're going nowhere. I wanna go everywhere. "Everyone has the right to happiness." - Me, too? - You too! And to life! To money! To swimming! To dick! To dick and half of mom's house! To dick and half of mom's house. Say it! To dick and half of mom's house! It's for tonight. The first payment has been wired to your account. Hold this. Another 68.000 small businesses have gone bankrupt since April. Bankruptcies are reaching epidemic proportions across the country. It's mine! No, it's mine! Stupid! Mom gave it to me, don't you get it? Keep it down! 65.000 Euros. It was wired this morning. Anything else? Hey, dad? It's me, Maria. They contacted me. It's official. The wind is just right. Are you insane? - I got in! - Congratulations! - Got in, where? - Athens Law School. - Let's go, Gogo! - I'll get the bells! Let's go! When do classes start? In September, you moron! Will I still see you? Why wouldn't you? From time to time. Who's gonna keep the store going? I don't know. I can't do it. Neither can mom. And dad said he wants to rest. Let's just shut it down. Let me go. Give me the key! What key? The key! Come on! Move! What the fuck? From now on, you bring all the mail home to me! Got it? Let's go. Bitch! Back in a minute! Mom, dad, Gogo! Happy New Year! I'm off! - Happy New Year, mommy! - Happy New Year, sweetie! - Did you lock up the store? - Yes. - The fridge? - Yes. - Was it busy? - Yes, we're rich! Maria, look! "FAREWELL". - Awesome, right? - It kicks major ass! - Watch your mouth, Gogo! - Look Gogo, up there! - Go fuck your mother, you piece of shit. - I fuck yours, cunt! - Suck my dick, fuck-face! Shove it up your ass! - Suck my dick! - Suck mine! - Why did you drop out of university? - Just because! I'm stuck looking after you and mom's store. Because you're such a retard. - I'm not! I have special needs and special abilities. I have a driver's license, too! - 'Cause dad bribed. - I vote, too! - That's why the country is a mess! - Off to get laid? Found a boyfriend? - Yes. Got a problem? - No, I found one, too. - No way! You're ugly and stupid! - So's your boyfriend. Is he outside? - Yes. Waiting patiently! With nothing but a T-shirt, in this cold! - A fuckin' faggot, I bet! - Even better! - What does he do? - He's a captain. - A brothel-creeper then! - That's how I like 'em. Mom's store will go bust, if you close it... ...every time you wanna get laid! - I'll burn it down if I want to! - I'll sue you. Half of it belongs to me! - Fuck off! - And quitjoining all those stupid groups! No hope for this world, anyway. - I'll do as I please, as long as I'm rid of you. - Fat ass cow! - Stupid cunt! Just like those wannabe-ecologist bitches... ...begging for blowjobs. - At least, I don't flash my tits every chance I get. - You blow them all! Unionists. Factory workers. Immigrants. Plus you've left your poor captain waiting! Gogo, I said, stop swearing! Good night! Will you love me forever? I will love you forever. More than anyone? More than anyone. No matter what happens? No matter what. No matter what I do? No matter what you do. Even if I don't love you anymore? Yes. Swear to me. You are going to study all the time... ...and don't drive aunt Gogo mad. Costas! Where's Gogo? She's on her way, she just called. Hey, sweetie... Don't you ever do that again! Oh really? Fuck you, too! Go fuck yourself! Gogo! Get in your aunt's car! Right now! Look here... You'll go to the bank and withdraw all the money. It'll be enough. Take Costas with you, just to be safe. And take your ID with you. Gogo... Focus! What did I just say? To bring my ID. - Do you have it? - Yes. Let's see it! It's right here. Maria, I found it! So, what do you do? Bring it with me. Go. I want us to have kids and I want us to have money. OK. So, how will you make it? I'll be making 6.000 Euros per month... I'll be at sea for six months and at home for three. Later on, I'll make even more. How much more? - A lot more. - How much? - How much? - A lot. I'll take my parents' house in Athens... When Gogo marries, I'll pack mom and dad off to the countryhouse. - Gogo will do what? - Get married. Who's gonna marry her, for Christ's sake? Dad found a garbage man who wants her. If you touch my children while I'm gone... I'll fucking beat the shit out of you, cunt! I'm not Gogo, you understand? I'll be back, cut your balls off and shove them down your throat. Got it? Cocksucker! This is Delta Papa 07 with the weather forecast for the Baltic and N. Seas... ... courtesy of the Hamburg maritime weather service... ... for today, 13.00 local time. Hi, Maria. He's back! Yannis! He's back! Have you fucking lost it? He's back! My love! Sit down, Costas. Hey, Costas. Costas, have you met Yannis? He's Maria's husband... - How's work, Costas? - It's good, thank God. - He's doing great, he's a manager. - I have a desk job, now. - Good for you! He's in charge of the whole place. - The entire garbage dump? - Yes. Are you top dog, now? No, there's a general manager, as well. Is it a permanent position? Yes, he said so, are you deaf? It will be, soon... It will be permanent, everyone at work loves him. - Including that Minister... - What about you? - He's a sailor. - A captain? - Yes, on a tankship. - Are you away a lot? He's never around. He's either gone, or he's away! So we went to see the so-called "garbage shower." Do you know what that is? The "garbage-shower"? Around 4.30am, right Costas? 4 am. At 4.30am all sorts of people, gypsies and the like come round... Immigrants, too... And wait for garbage trucks to arrive... ...and empty their load. And all these people stand underneath... We're talking, entire families! They've got these iron sticks... Right, Costas? Iron sticks with hooks on one end. They stand behind the trucks... and punch holes in the garbage bags... and they're literally showered with that shit! - Did you shower, as well? - Yes, yes! No, Costas wouldn't let me. Costas, why not? I would, if we had uniforms on. I'm shocked by this story. Shocked or not, we don't care. What do you think, life is easy? Like yours? People have a hard time! Costas sees it every day. Pour me some more wine! I will marry a captain... ... a true-blue sailor! When are you leaving? Next week. Will you be around when Maria gives birth? Yes. - Do you know her due date? - I do. - Is it a boy or a girl? - A boy. What's your problem, Gogo? I care about you, you idiot! I'm the one who has to go to the clinic with you. Who else will, mom? I bet you'll deliver my baby yourself. Stop fighting! I planted an olive tree... I did it when... It's time now. I have to go. I told you, just for a week... Yannis, please don't go... I don't know what to do when you're away. It's all crap! Hi, Maria. - Can I ask you something? - Sure. - Is there a computer I can use? - Fourth door on your right. Heat and strong northwest winds. Wind speed. 40 knots. - What are you laughing at? - What on earth are you doing? - That's how you showed me! - You want me to show you? - Want me to show you? - Yeah, show me! Gently... Hello, Mr Constantinidis. What? She hasn't called you? Shall I call you later tonight? When I get home? All of us... ... this government and the Greek people... ... we have inherited a ship ready to sink. A country with no credibility... ... with no respect even from its friends and allies. Yes. Yes, Mr Constantinidis. How much? Bye. Mom? Gogo? Costas, where's Gogo? How the fuck should I know? Can I see the tax records, please? What tax records? Your dad's? I don't need dad's. I mean yours, from the store! - What for? - I just want to take a look. They're at my accountant's. Give him a ring... I just got off the phone with him. You haven't seen him in ages! - Maria, what's wrong with you? - You stay out of it. Stand up. Stand up! Stand up, thejoke is over! It's over! - Maria, have you gone mad? - Shut up! It's over! What are these? What the fuck are all these? Have you got any idea how much money we owe? You'll go to jail, don't you get it? How will you pay your debts? With dad's pension? Where will you get the money? Where? Who's gonna give it to you? 30 trips of Yannis wouldn't be enough to pay what you owe! Get out! Shame on you! - Hello. - Hello... My mom has a store and she owes money to the tax-office. Can you please tell us the exact amount? I have an account of my mother's. It's linked to a consumer loan. I deal with her finances. Are you a co-owner? No, everything belongs to my mom. Then your mother has to come in person. - She can't. - Why not? She's housebound, she's an invalid. We have a consumer loan, it's 22 monthly installments of 680 Euros. And my mom is already 12 months behind. Hello. I brought everything you asked me to. My mom's authorization... The social security certificate... ...and from the Department of Labor Inspection... It can't be done. I'm really sorry. I don't want to give you false hope. You own a house of 120 square metres in Agii Anargiri... My mother does. A mini-market, also your mother's... - Yes. - A country house. Yes. If you don't want it all to be mortgaged... ...I need to check if you can pay back what you owe. How can you tell, if it has to be mortgaged... ...if you still don't know the exact amount? That's what I'm asking! - Have you been officially hired? - Of course, years ago. So you have a social security number and everything? Legally? Of course, sir! I don't know what you're asking! What are you looking at? - Who are you, sir? - He's my father. We don't need to tell you our life's story! - He's my father! - Your father? Can't you just do your job? Our family story is none of your business. - OK. - Don't OK me! - Just do your job properly. - That's what I'm doing. Do your job. You're constantly being ironic, sir! Ironic! - That's right, I truly am. - Stop it, dad! - Can we move on? - Have you calmed down? - You're a bit edgy as family. - Yes... It's not good for your children. I don't need your advice for my children. It's milk you want, right? But not from the store. You want me to go to the supermarket. I took your money. What do you mean? All of it? Great. You did just fine. Did you see Costas on TV? And that toothless guy behind him, going... Yannis... What am I going to do? What are you staring at? You have to come home earlier. Please. Have you completely lost your mind? - What do you want? - Hi, Gogo. - Hi Yannis! - Yannis, I'm hanging up. - Tell your husband to cut the shit out. - Go fuck yourself. What do you want? Why are you messing with mom's money? Just take care for your kids! - Shut up! - You shut up! - It's my money, too. - Since when do you care? Since now! You'll put mom in jail. Mom will put us all in jail, not me! Tell Costas not to be a cunt. Yannis is right. Yannis ought to be here, looking after his kids! If I see Costas with the fascists again, I'll kick him out. It's still mom's house. - Does he beat you? - Yes, and I like it. - More than I do? - Way more... Dad is downstairs, crying. That's all he's good for. You deal with him. He pisses me off. The doctor just told me I can't have kids. I'll have enough for the both of us. I'll get pregnant again when Yannis gets back. Rabbit-mom! Costas says we're fascists because we're nouveaux pauvres. He's a retard. Dad will make you divorce him. I don't give a fuck what dad says, anyway. The situation in downtown Athens is tense. Right-wing extremists are randomly attacking immigrants. It all started after a demonstration... The attacks began when protesters reached the City Hall... - Hello. - Hi. I brought you the check. It's the first installment. Can you invoice me, so I can get to the cashier's desk? - Whose signature is this? - Mine. - Yours? - Yes. - But the name on the front? - Can't you see? - Your husband's. - Yes. Your husband's name is in the front and your signature on the back. - Where is your husband? - He's away, at sea. He can't sign checks while he's away. - But this is wrong. - What do you mean? I can't accept it. Can you please take it? Please leave! Get out! Shame on you! Yannis! Yannis, can you hear me? Could you do me a favor? I need the number for that guy who spoke at "EarthAct"... ...about villages, beaches and coastlines. Yes. My dad told me something about his village, I want to check it out. The easiest way to declassify woodlands... ...and sell them off for construction or farming... ...is to burn it along with some farmland... ...classify it as a reforestation area and then, partially declassify it. To burn the forests, they use both locals and professionals. You have to resist. In every village. In every town. You, for example. Where are you from, originally? - From Athens. - Athens! Your parents are from Athens, too? Your father? - He grew up in a village. - A village. Which one? - It's called Agia Triada. - Is it by the sea? It has a beach. And a forest. Hello. This is our room today. Who would like to go first? Me. Last night he came home and started yelling. He went on and on that I'm useless, that I'm worth nothing. But I don't really mind, because it's true. As he was yelling, I gradually felt... ...a sense of detachment. A break from reality. My reality. Without him noticing, I started touching my breast... ...and then, one by one, the scars from my operations. I wanted to make sure they were still there. But they weren't. As if they were simply gone. They didn't belong to me, anymore. They were gone. And everything else was gone with them. My childhood... My girlfriends... My mom... My summers... The smell of wet bathing suits... And all of a sudden, in front of the sink... I was no more. And then something strange happened. I felt gratitude. I felt sad... And grateful. Hold it, asshole. Yannis, it's Maria. At mom's funeral. Yannis, I need an answer. Will you come? I said, are you coming? You're not coming. That's all I needed to know. Hello... We met some time ago, at the "EarthAct" seminars... You talked about illegal development on the coastal zones of our hometowns. Can you hear me? I just wanted to ask if you're aware of the Agia Triada case. It's about a hotel resort. A company, trying to built a resort. Yes, on woodlands. Which company? GBM. So, you're already in touch with the locals? The local committee? Great, that's all I wanted to know. Thanks. Who would like to go next? Go ahead, Maria! Would you like to stand up? As you all know, it's the first time Maria speaks to us. And as you know from experience, it's a very big step. Let's clap! Hello... I want to say that I am luckier... I'm luckier than all of you. My husband never beats me or treats me badly. The truth is, he loves me. He loves me very much. But this doesn't seem to matter at all anymore. Today... I want to share with you... ...that I am absolutely unhappy. I've lived... ...a ridiculous life. I don't know what to do to change it. I got married when I was 20 years old and I have three kids... ...that I never want to see again. Neither them nor my husband. From now on I only want to speak with strangers. Like you. And I... I prefer the guilt... I feel for that... ...to the life I had until this day. Growing up, no one had told me my life would be like this. That this is what it would be. Today... I pray... ...for a life, if not less vain... ...at least, less painful. Thanks for listening. I swear... ... to be faithful to my country. To obey the Constitution... ... the laws and the legislation of the nation. Submission to my superiors... ... to perform their commands promptly... ... and without contradiction. - Something stuck in your throat, boy? - No. So, why are you stuttering? I officially proclaim, I have no excuse. Tie your shoelaces! - I'll do it! - No, mom, no! Fuck the Greek Navy! Fuck the State! Humiliation and degradation! Fucked all over! To the last drop of my sperm! You are nothing but a burden. That's what you've become. It's 65.000 Euros to the bank and another 100.000 to the tax-office. That's what we owe. That's mom's legacy. And the only thing you know how to do... ...when you do come with me, is cause trouble... ...and destroy everything I try to build. Because you think you understand. That's what you are! Someone who thinks he understands, something he does not understand. And lets everything go on and on. With me... With mom, with Gogo, with everything. Because you love us. Because you're kind. Because that's how you feel. Or because you're just plain stupid. A stupid old man, who doesn't know what he's doing or where he's going. So... We don't care how you feel. We don't care what you think. You'll go to the country house. You'll take your pension, your books and go to the country house. And you'll stay there. I'll have my baby and I'll take care of everything myself. And when it's needed, you'll simply help me. Are you awake? - Where to? - Athens. Will you love me forever? I will love you forever. More than anyone? More than anyone. No matter what? Yes. No matter what. - No matter what I do? - No matter what you do. Even if I don't love you anymore? You motherfucker! Get out! - Why did you burn us? - I didn't do anything! - You wanna get married? - Yes. Gogo? What are you doing here? Where's Maria? I don't know... she left us the kids. She gave me money and told me not to call you. And she beat up Costas. Help me... We can keep the kids, we've prepared everything. What are you staring at? Technical Processing Chris Choreftis
