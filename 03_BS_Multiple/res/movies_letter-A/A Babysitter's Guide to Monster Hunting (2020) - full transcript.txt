So… Yeah, when I was five. You ate crayons when we were kids. No one calls you Crayola Mouth. That's because crayons are delicious. Let's face it, monsters aren't real. Oh, my God. Even my best friend thinks I'm crazy. Yeah. You are crazy. That's why you're my best friend. - (CRASH) - BOY: Hey! Give me my wig back! You know the rules, Jesper. - There's no costumes allowed. - Hah! Yeah? It's Halloween! This is unconstitutional. - Give... Everyone, listen up! - (FEEDBACK SQUEALS) All right? Big time Halloween party at mine tonight! Costumes are not only allowed, they're mandatory! - (CHEERING) - Okay? We should totally go to that party. I don't know. Jesper is a senior. We're only freshmen. Kelly, it's Halloween. The one night we can be anything we want. Anything in the world.

Oh, just… makin' a Halloween costume. Oh! Uh… For what? (SIZZLING) Um… Uh... Halloween party at a friend's house. And you were planning on going? Uh, yeah, I am. (GASPS) (SIZZLING) Oh, I... I may have suggested that you would… Babysit for Ms. Zellman. - Your boss? - Mm-hm. - The Ice Queen? - Uh, yes, but don't... don't call her that. No, thanks. Well, my company Halloween party is tonight, and I overheard Ms. Zellman complaining that she couldn't find a sitter, so I thought... Well, I thought you could… So, you threw my name out there to babysit? Yes. - Mom! - Well… - Dad! Mom sold me out to her boss! - (SIGHS) - DAD: Listen to your mother, Kelly. - (KELLY SCOFFS) - Thanks for havin' my back, Dad! - DAD: No problem, sweetie. You know, I can barely keep my phone charged, let alone take care of some kid. Okay. Kelly, please. (SIGHS) Now, if I cancel on Ms. Zellman, she'll be furious. (WHISPERS) This is the Ice Queen we're talking about. - But... - Besides, it's only babysitting, - and I think it will be… - What... - …really good for you. Plus… - But... …you'll make 15 dollars an hour. You can totally do this, sweetie! Hm? Fine. Thank you. Thank you! You're gonna be great! (SIGHS) (BUZZING) CLICK: (LAUGHING) The Ice Queen? (TINKLING) I... I... I mean, your costume is... it's literally... Hi, Ms. Zellman. Kelly. (SIGHS) - This way. - (JINGLING) I printed up a list of no-no's. Kelly! (HEELS TAPPING) "No ice cream, no gluten, no caffeine, no dairy, no peanuts, no more than 30 minutes of screen time"? You have a stopwatch on your cell phone, right? - I… I... - Because it's Halloween, Jacob may have three pieces of candy. - Oh! I've got some... - No, no, no, no. Raisins, dried apple chips, or puffed rice cakes. Also, no running, no shouting, no discussing global tragedies or current events. - Got it. - Emergency contact numbers. Poison control, his doctor, his dentist. And his sleep time checklist. Learn it. It takes three hours just to put him to sleep? If he goes to sleep at all. (SIGHS) Jacob? Jacob… This is your babysitter, Kelly. (JINGLING) Hi, Jacob. Please don't go, Mommy. - Halloween's scary. - It'll be okay, honey. I promise. Your muzzie-wuzzie loves you so much. - This way, Kelly. - (JINGLING) (HEELS TAPPING) Kelly! (DOOR CLOSES) I'll be home at midnight. Follow the list. Lock the doors. And no trick-or-treaters. None. And keep Jacob safe. Midnight. Sharp. - (HEELS TAPPING QUICKLY) - Okay, bye. - (CLATTERING) - (GASPS) (RATTLING) (CLATTERING CONTINUES) (RUSTLING) (RUSTLING CONTINUES) Jacob? What are you doing? Hey! Spit that out! (GASPS) Don't put me to bed! I can't go to sleep. - Why not? - I have bad nightmares. Sometimes, at night, that comes out of my fish tank. It feels like it's coming to get me, but Mom says it's just a nightmare. I actually know a lot about nightmares. - You do? - Yeah. And I get it. Sometimes, they feel real. Like, really real. But it's just your mind playing tricks on you. They can't hurt you. Mine can. I can make monsters. There's no such thing as monsters. But there is… Quackers the Duck! ♪ Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo Doo-doo-doo-doo! Doo-doo-doo! ♪ And his main man, Tedster. - ♪ Doo-doo-doo-doo! ♪ - (CRIES) Whoa! - What happened to Tedster? - I dreamt he was on fire. And when I woke up, he was. (TEDSTER, SLOWLY) I want to hug you. - I don't like his hugs. - (SIGHS) If it makes you feel any better, when I was a little kid, I thought my bad dreams could come true too. What did you do? I grew up. Now I'm just scared of real-life stuff, like climate change, and inequality, and talking to boys, and, like, everything I read on Twitter. It's really scary. I'm not helping, am I? (SIGHS) All right. Fine. How about… I check under your bed? (SIGHS) (GRUNTS) - (SCREAMS) - What is it? Dirty socks! (SIGHS) Not cool. Ah, classic. Nothing in here either. (CREAKING) Okay, but don't turn off the lights! I'm afraid of the dark. You know what I do when I get scared of the dark? I make… These. These… Are my own personal night-lights. This one's especially fun. Look. (JACOB GASPS) Whoa. KELLY: You can have this one. JACOB: Thanks. - CHILD 1: Thank you! - CHILD 2: Come on! - (LAUGHTER) - (SCREECHING SOUND EFFECT) CHILD 3: Trick or treat! - Wait up! - Thank you. (SCREECHING SOUND EFFECT) MAN: Hey, everyone, slow down. - CHILD: Trick or treat! - BOY: Yeah, I know! - (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) - KELLY: All right, engage my FOMO. How's the party? BOY: It's amazing! Wait. What's your costume? I am the crown jewel of nutritious snacks. - I'm "Broccoli." - (LAUGHS) Oh… (LIGHTS BUZZING) (SQUELCHING) (CRUNCHING) (CRACKLES) - (LOUD POP MUSIC PLAYING) - (CHEERING) Dude, dude! Look who's here! You gotta get over here, Kelly. Deanna is about to walk that plank. Are you broccoli? Uh… Yeah, that... that's me. (LAUGHS) I love broccoli. - (LAUGHS) - GIRL: Do you wanna dance? - Go get 'em, Tommy. - TOMMY: All right. I... I'd love to. (FIRE ROARS) (FIREWORKS EXPLODING OUTSIDE) (LIGHTS BUZZING) (WHIRRING) (LIGHTS CRACKLING) - (BLEEPING) - ROBOT: Enemy alert. Enemy alert.

Uh, no. - (WHIMPERS) None of that. (MUFFLED GROANS) Mmm! Mmm! - Come again? - Mmm! Mmm! Enunciate, darling. Try using your words. (WHIMPERS) - I kid. I kid! - Mmmph! (CONTINUES WHIMPERING) Just a tentacle? Not attached to anything. Now that's an outside the box nightmare, even for me. - (JACOB WHIMPERING) - Aah! (THUD) You and I are about to unleash your nightmares on the world. (ECHOING CRASH) (CRASHING STAMPING CONTINUES) (RUMBLING) KELLY: Jacob? - Mmm! Mmm! - (RATTLING) - (MUFFLED SCREAMING) - (BANGING) - (JACOB WHIMPERING) - (GRUNTING) (SLURPING) (SLURPING CONTINUES) Mm?

(ROARS) - (KELLY GRUNTING) - (MONSTER GROWLING) - (SHRIEKS) - (GRUMBLES) (JACOB WHIMPERING) - Hey! Stop that! - (GROWLING) (JACOB WHIMPERING) (SQUEALS) (BABBLES) (FEMALE MONSTER SHRIEKING) - No! - (GROWLING) (MONSTERS CHUCKLING) (SQUEALS) (GRUNTS) No! (RUMBLING) KELLY: Nine-one-one? Hi. These... these things just took the kid I was babysitting. I'm pretty sure they're monsters. Yes, I am aware it's Halloween night, but this… this is not a joke. This is serious. These were proper creatures of the night, they... they... Hello? Hello? Who are you? Liz Lerue. Babysitter. We got a nightmare ping come from here. - Who are you? - I'm the babysitter. I'll be the judge of that. (SIGHS) Where's your charge? - (BABY COOS) - My… The kid. Your child. The human being you're supposed to be responsible for? - I don't know! - (BABY GURGLES) These things came out from under the bed. They took him. Look, I tried calling the police, but they thought it was a prank. - Hey! You can't go in there! - What'd these things look like? Um, they were small and fat, with crazy teeth and weird hair. - How many? - Um… three. - (GRUNTS) God! - Height? Weight? Speech patterns? What were they wearing? Did they have eyes? Um, they were two to three feet high. Uh, claws. They had weird mouths and two eyes, lopsided. This way! They looked like this! Toadies. What's a "Toadie"? Also, whose baby is that? Is it yours? I'm not judging if it is. This is Carmella. - Carmella, say hi. Don't be shy. - (GURGLES) I'm babysitting her because that's what actual babysitters do. We watch and protect our kids. Now, stand over there and play the quiet game. (WHIRRING) KELLY: Ow! "The time of nightmares has begun"? Which way'd they go? (WHIRRING) Twelve degrees north-east. LIZ: You're like a calculator. What time are the parents home? KELLY: Midnight. His mom is very intense. She would never be late. LIZ: Okay. Stay here, chew your hair, find out what you'd look like with dog ears, I don't care. But if the mom calls, you act like everything's cool. - Got it? - (CARMELLA BABBLES) Good. (FOOTSTEPS GETTING FAINTER) (PANTING) Excuse you! I'm coming with you. No. You will just get in my way. Or you'll get possessed, hypnotized, cursed, boiled, or turned into a three-headed dog of darkness. For real? Wait, did you even see this? - (WHIRRING) - KELLY: These burn marks. They come from out of Jacob's window, run down here, and then they just vanish. And those tracks. They don't match the claws that those trollies had... LIZ: Toadies. Toadies had. And they have an entirely different pattern and diameter, which means a completely different thing was here. - (CLOSES ZIP) - (SIGHS) Okay, CSI: Rhode Island. - Your funeral. - Ow. - Jump on. The clock's ticking. - (STARTS ENGINE) - (WHIMPERS) - LIZ: Hang on, Carmella. ♪ They strip away your senses ♪ ♪ But intuition know-ows ♪ ♪ That at night the senses ♪ - ♪ Get ready for the show-ow… ♪ - We've got Toadies on our hands. Bring me up on the tracker. Are you talking to me? Pull up a map of their main tunnels. - "Tunnels"? - Will you knock it off? No! Not you, just some girl. ♪ It's goin' down, down, down… ♪ LIZ: Anything on the monster tracker? GPR activity near Sharkie Park? Copy that. ♪ And it's gone runnin' ♪ ♪ Trouble's comin' ♪ - KELLY: GPR? - LIZ: Ground-penetrating radar. Toadies have a network of tunnels under the city. Sometimes our monster GPR picks up their movements. (CHATTERING AND SQUEAKING) - KELLY: We're not going in the tunnels. - LIZ: Nope. - (CLANG) - LIZ: We are fishing for Toadies. KELLY: Ball pits. So gross. Like, gross to the third power. LIZ: Math jokes, huh? Funny. Anyway, look for a hidden tunnel. Should be around here somewhere. - KELLY: How do you know all this stuff? - LIZ: Check the bag. (BLEEP) "Babysitter's Guide to Monster Hunting"? LIZ: It's a collection of thousands of years' worth of monster hunting wisdom passed down through the ages. Memorize the guide, stay alive. So I'm not crazy. LIZ: Found it. - I mean, can you believe this? - (BABBLING) Uh, the Toadies dug their tunnel right at the end of the slide, so when a kid comes shooting down… Whoosh! Right into their trap. - (CARMELLA COOING) - KELLY: This is insane. What should I do? - Maybe take off her jacket? - Okay. - (CLINK) - (WHOOSH) - (SNAP) - CLICK: - (RASPBERRY) - (CHUCKLES) - KELLY: Why do you need baby powder? - (SIGHS) - LIZ: Read the guide. - (COOING) LIZ: All right, come on. "Beware. Toadies love the smell of newborns. They cannot resist a taste." One of 'em pops out looking for a snack, boom, got 'em. You're using the baby as bait? No! Listen, this is the only thing that will get them up to the surface. (GRUNTING AND GROWLING) (BABBLING) (POWERING UP) - KELLY: What's that? - (RUMBLING) - Those are sound vibrations. - (CARMELLA COOING) - (RUMBLING CONTINUES) - (CARMELLA FUSSING) (SCRABBLING) (RUMBLING INTENSIFIES) (BURBLING) (GROWLS) - I can't do this! - Kelly! No! - (TOADIE YELLS) - (CARMELLA COOING) (SHRIEKS) - (BABBLES) - (KELLY YELLS) LIZ: Oh, come on! (SCREECHES) (TOADIES CHATTERING) - (WHIMPERS) - (GROWLS) By the Order of the Babysitters, I demand you return that child! - (BABBLES) - (BLOWS RASPBERRY) - (JACOB CRYING) - Come on! Don't worry, Carmella. I'm gonna keep you safe. - (KELLY SCREAMS) - (RUMBLING) (HISSING) (WHIMPERING) - (GROWLS) - LIZ: Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Look what I've got. If you give us the boy, you get sparkly. - What do you say? - (CHATTERS) LIZ: Come on, don't play hardball with me. - You guys love to trade. - (KELLY MUTTERING) - LIZ: Jacob or sparkly? - KELLY: Okay. Hello. Hi. Do we have a deal? (SCOFFS) - (GROWLING) - (GRUNTS) - (PHONE PLAYING MUSIC) - Okay. Damn. Shut that off! It's Jacob's mom! Ms. Zellman? Hi. How's the monster? What? Oh! You mean... No. Yeah. Um... Everything's fine. Jacob and I are having so much fun. - (TOADIE GURGLING) - What's that noise? Uh… It's… it's a movie. That sounds like a scary movie. Check the list, Kelly. No scary movies. No, no, no, no, no! It's... it's a fun movie. - It's about unicorns and rainbows and… - (TOADIE CHATTERING AND GROWLING) (RUNNING FOOTSTEPS) - (LIZ YELLS) - (ROARS) What was that? - KELLY: Um… - (CHITTERING) - A… unicorn fell off a… a rainbow. - (TOADIE SQUEALING) KELLY: But it was saved by a cloud. We're all good here. Let me speak to Jacob. Now! Um, no, he's sleeping. You said you were watching a movie. - (CHITTERING) - LIZ: Oh, no you're not! No! No, he just... He just fell asleep like that. He did? (LAUGHS) Oh. That's a first. Tonight is a night of firsts. WOMAN: The tenth annualcompany costume party is about to begin! (PARTYGOERS CHEERING) MS. ZELLMAN: I'm glad Jacob fell asleep early. - (SQUEALING) - Yeah. Me too. Remember. Midnight. - Okay. Bye. Bye. - Sharp. - Bye, bye, bye. - (LIZ YELLS) (TOADIE GROANING) (CARMELLA CHUCKLES) (TOADIE GROANING) KELLY: I'm gonna be grounded for all of eternity. The Toadies left with Jacob. So, how are we gonna get him back now? That's why this little creep's comin' with us. - (CARMELLA COOS) - It's nine o'clock, Carmella. - We'll get you home, sweetie. - (COOING) The Toadies always trade. This is worse than I thought. - (BANGING) - (TOADIE GRUMBLING) (SQUEALING) - (THUMPING) - (GROANING) (WAILING) (GROANS) (PANTING) - (WHIMPERS) - (BABBLES) - (JACOB YELLING) - (CHATTERING) (GROANS) (CRYING) Oh, hootie-hoo! Well, well, well. The guest of honor has arrived, finally! I trust your travels were smooth. Mmm! Oh, yeah. I forgot. - (CLICKS FINGERS) - (GASPS) - (MAN SIGHS) - (CROAKING) - I wanna go home! - You're not going anywhere. Huh? Impressive, isn't it? I suppose you want to know how it all works. (CHUCKLES) I've slowly, but surely, accumulated 51 rare gases and mixed them with the perfect specificity. Why, you ask? To fill these beautiful tanks with enough power to manifest my army of nightmares into actual life! Aah! Terrors alive like never seen before. - (WIND WHISTLING) - Aah! All I needed was just one more little tiny ingredient, a pathetic yet highly imaginative little twerp, personified in this case by… well… You, get it? (WHIMPERS) You, my dear boy, will conjure an army of infinite nightmares. You and I are about to ruin the world. Sleepy time. ♪ Kids, I come… ♪ KELLY: Wow. We got the baby back to her parents just in time. I hope she wasn't too freaked out. LIZ: Freaked out? Carmella loves monster hunting. ♪ Kids, I come for you… ♪ How much did her parents pay for you to look after Carmella? Two hundo. Cash. Is that the going rate these days for using a baby as bait?

Archimedes, Frida Kahlo, Florence Nightingale, Maria Tallchief, Noor Inayat Khan. LIZ: Yeah. We've been around for thousands of years. Tell anyone about our location, and I'll feed you to our resident hobgoblin. Listen up, SITs. Our mission is Jacob Zellman. Five years old, possibly with the Gift of Dreams. We have three hours and five minutes until his mom gets back and finds her little bundle of joy missing. (WHIRRING) Nothing new from the surveillance cameras. Hey, Berna, will you start the laser scan? - On it. - (BLEEP) (WHIRRING) GIRL: All right. Let's take a look in this Toadie's pouch. What the heck? Is that half a duck? KELLY: It's a goose lamp. - How big are their pouches? - Who's the human? This is Kelly. GIRL: And why exactly is she here? She was with the kid when he got taken. - We need to pick her brain. - But... Just search the thing for clues. Rude. It's not a "thing." It's a Monstria Chordata Amphibia Carnivora of the Toadie subspecies. - (SIGHS) Remove her. - Cassie, this isn't your call. You're just a Sitter in Training. I mean, see this? And this? And this? Chapter Vice President. Okay? It's gonna take me hours to remove the items from its pouch. Better get to it, then. - I'm so sorry. So sorry. - LIZ: Follow me. Hey. So, this Jacob kid really has the Gift of Dreams? I... I just told her what Jacob told me. I don't even really know what the Gift of Dreams is. It's... it's legendary. A young kid who is supposed to be able to bring dreams to life. Or nightmares. The Order was founded to protect kids like that. I could tell you a bit more over a cup of coffee, maybe? Pump the brakes, Casanova. Can you make one of your memory potions? Uh… Yeah. I, uh… I have a passion for potions. - KELLY: What is that? - It's Minotaur Memory Dust. Three parts beetle root, one part gnome guano. Yet, I have not tested this batch out yet, so I hope I don't fry her brain. Fry my brain… Now, tell us every single detail you remember when Jacob was taken. ♪ Do as, mm-mmm ♪ ♪ Now give into the mm-mm-mmm ♪ Maybe I used too much beetle root?

BOY: He's the Stealer of Dreams, the Bringer of Nightmares. Legend has it he's collecting bad dreams from kids to build a nightmare army. That's him. LIZ: What do you mean? That's the monster who tried to take me when I was a little girl! No. No way. Liz, those prints I found. They were tail marks, just like this. I think he's what took Jacob. This can't be happening. Not again. - A-Are you okay? - Well, you see, her... BERNA: It's not our story to tell, Curtis. "The Grand Guignol travels in the Nightmare Realm. The Boogeypeople are almost impossible to locate when they are in there." Boogeypeople? Seven, actually. They're like a monster mafia. My whole life, my whole life I was told this wasn't real. That it didn't happen. But now… - But now… - This is why we don't let normies in here. Each of us has been through a monster attack. This is from a Class Two Oozer. CURTIS: Yeah, I've got one of those, too. Fire-spitting Grunk. - CURTIS: I was impaled by a Brush troll. - BERNA: This is from a vampire rabbit. - CASSIE: Krampus. - BERNA: Thunderbird. - CURTIS: Baba Yaga. - CASSIE: Bunnicula. Paper cut. - CURTIS: I got this from a Cloud Serpent. - No one wants to see that, Curtis. That's why we're here. To make sure what happened to us never happens to another kid. - (STRAIGHTENS JACKET) - (SIGHS) So how do we take down the Grand Guignol? We don't. Well, there is a way. It's a combination between… Angel Fire and Monster Punch. Yet the ingredients are crazy combustible. We're talking, uh, uh… cobalt from Athena's tomb, um… Chupacabra venom... - None of which we have. - Don't worry. - I have my sources. - KELLY: And the Monster Punch? That's the only way to drive the Angel Fire into the Boogeyman's heart. It's crazy hard to execute, even if you could get near him. It's never been done. There's a solution to every problem. LIZ: All right. Let's put that to the test. Curtis, gather the essentials. Yes! Time to geek out. Follow me! Come on! (BLEEPING) (WHIRRING) - CURTIS: Check this out. - (BELL DINGS) KELLY: A jump rope? CURTIS: No, it's not actually a jump rope. It's a net made from powerful Stiltskin Thread. Pull the handle and… pshoom! (CHUCKLES) (BELL DINGS) This is the Mist of Hypnos. One spray can knock a lesser monster out cold. CASSIE: Stop trying to impress her. I am not! (BELL DINGS) And this… Is the Booyah Bear. Yank the ear and throw. Go ahead. Check it out. (TICKING) - (TICKING SPEEDS UP) - It's... it's not working. - Throw it, Kelly! - Okay! Booyah! (CURTIS LAUGHS) Smoke diversion! - LIZ: Don't waste the weapons, Curtis. - (CURTIS SIGHS) Let's go. - Back to work, SITs. - Wait, Kelly. One more thing.

He's my brother. The Grand Guignol took your brother? I was six, Kevin was five. It was midnight. There was a scratch at the window. I thought it was a tree branch or the wind. I jumped out of bed, drew back the curtains… And that's when I saw him. He sang us a song, and I fell under a spell. When I came to, Kevin was gone. I never saw my brother again. I've been looking for him my whole life. I mean, that's the reason I became a babysitter. Liz, I… - I'm so sorry. - Well, don't be. - It... it wasn't your fault. - No one believes that.
