foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Here. You got it? It's okay, it's okay. Hey. Everything's okay. Come here, gorgeous, let's lay you down. Jason! Jason, Jason, shit, no! God, God, what have you done? Shit! Fuck! Mom? - Aaah. - A little bit wider. - Aaah. - Okay, good. Let me just clean these a bit. That's it. And done. All right, Isabelle, you're all done for today. Mom! All good. Good? Everyone can see from the science corridor and everything. Why would you say that? No, it was so hot. I just think it's important for you to know. Oh, that's very helpful. Thank you. I'm so embarrassed. Right, where are we gonna put these letters? Um, I actually think they could be nice just, like, in the middle just so it's... I don't know, I think... I think that's a lot. Like, it's just a lot going on if it's in the middle. Do you know what I mean? Oh, my God, Max just put our campaign in his story. But isn't that kind of the point, though, just to get attention and raise money? I don't know, I think if you just... if you move them to the bottom. - Like, move all of them... - Yes, like that? - Yeah, it's not so on the nose, like it's just... - Mm. - What do you think, yeah? - Yeah, yeah, that works as well. - Mm. - What are you guys wearing tomorrow? - I'm wearing this really nice jean jacket. - Is it big? Yeah, it's really nice and fun. - It's really nice. - I'm gonna wear... Guys, you don't understand how bad these butt patches were. I'm not joking... I'm gonna wear my green skirt and then maybe your gray jumper? Isabelle! - Isabelle, can you move your shoes? - In a minute! - I feel like not enough people saw enough. - Oh, yeah? - I'm gonna wear your gray jumper. - That's cool. That goes well together. That's really nice. - Hey, how'd it go? - Oh, God! It's just another flagrant guilt trip about her poor thumb-sucking gums. I mean, the only brace that she would even begin to consider is some invisible thing. I mean, it's just gonna burn through our savings. Oh, dear. Hey. I got one more thing for you. Take one of these. - Okay, see you next week. - Thank you. Betsey Hughes? - Hi, Betsey. - Hi. Are you any closer to narrowing down your options? Um, well, I'm... I'm just still thinking. Your highest grades are across the sciences. You were leaning that way before, weren't you? Yeah, I just... I'm not really sure science is my thing anymore. I see that you've taken some time out from school, and that may mean that it will take you a little bit longer to come to a decision. Have you considered a gap year? Travel, maybe? I, uh... I don't think my mom would like that very much. Well, you've got a couple more weeks for the extended deadline. But you need to allow time for the forms and statement. Why don't you sign up for another appointment next week? And in the meantime, have a think about what really interests you. Maybe start a list. Hmm! Hey. Sorry. Well, you look nice. - I like your lips. - Thanks. Trying something new. Oh. Hey. Yeah, yeah, I'll be right out. Yeah, okay. Hey, Dom's waiting for me. See you later. Mom? Mom? Mom, I'm going now. Trying to say goodbye. You okay? I'm fine, just hiding from the washing up. You staying at Dominic's tonight? Maybe. I don't know. I'm not sure yet. Okay, text me when you know. - Okay. - Have fun. Love you! I love you back. Are you all right? Hmm? Thanks. You, uh, wanna try something? - Yeah. - Yeah, all right. Oh! Fuck, what was that? - Stop laughing, stop laughing. - Ugh. It's just powdered alcohol. It's just powdered alcohol. - Are you okay? - You're an asshole. I'm sorry. It was a joke. You know, they got me too. - Hey, hey, I'm sorry. - Uh-uh, it's fine, it's fine. - I'm going out for a smoke. - I'm sorry, baby. It was just a bit of fun. Listen, I'm a victim and all. - Let's get Adam and that. - No, let's get Grace. Grace? - Yeah. - Grace. Dom, can I get a drink? Um, help yourself. Let me try yours, mate. You're the one that's not been drinking. Just one sip, bruh. Come on. Something light. Come on, drink, drink, drink, drink. What's Betsey doing? - She's blazed. - Wait. How much alcohol did you put in that condom? Oh, my God. Dom. Dom! Oh, love, what happened? Can we please just go home? - Hey, Mom. - Hey! You feeling better? I don't know. My... my skin's all tingly. Tingling? Yeah, yeah, like numb or something. - How much did you drink? - It's not that. Hey, baba. Don't worry, it's probably just a little allergic reaction maybe from, you know, sulfates or a little bug. Probably just hung over. I'm gonna take Izzy to the rink later. I don't know... do you want a lift or do you wanna come? She'd really like that. Shit! So we're going around in a circle this morning. And we're gonna go round, yes, and then try balancing on that one leg. So we're trying to balance on our left leg, all right? Weight over this side. Okay, keep it up there, keep your head up. Yeah, nice little stretch, just feel it at the back. Okay, all right. So now we go into the back, go. - What, like that? - Yeah, good. - I'm gonna go to the bathroom. - Mm. Hold it, that's it. - All right, go and do it again. - Oh, hello. - Hi, Sarah. - Hi. It's fine. I could have it worse, of course. I don't mean to moan. What about you? How are things? You know, keeping busy. Where's Betsey applying to uni? - She doesn't know yet. - Oh. Well, it's been a difficult year for her, poor thing. For all of you. It's not just that, though, you know? I don't know. What? I mean, it doesn't matter. - What? - No, it's nothing, really. - I... it's silly. - No, go on. What? I just wonder what... the point of it all is, you know? I know. You really have to wonder what's a degree even worth these days. And the pressure these girls are getting from all sides. You know, with the testing and all the extracurricular stuff. I said to Caroline the other day, "You need to be careful. You really need to buckle down and do some work, because if you don't, you'll get left behind. And trust me..." It started about a week ago. It started seven days ago. Sorry, it started exactly a week ago. Okay. And it comes in waves. That's right, isn't it? Yeah, it... it's all over my body sometimes. Like, my skin just shuts off. - Shuts off? - Yeah. I don't know, it's weird. Is it happening right now? Any other symptoms? Fatigue, muscle ache, memory issues? - I haven't really been eating. - Oh. I just get nauseous around food since it started. Would you mind popping on to the bed for me, please? Just leave your coat. If you could lie down for me. If you can pull your shirt up for me so I can just examine your tummy a second. That's good, just that. Feel any pain? No? Good, you can sit up for me. So, um, how's down below? Passing urine, bowel movement, menstrual cycles? That's, um... it's all fine. Are you sexually active? - That's not the problem. - Using protection? We've discussed being safe. Some stress at home? - Stress at school? - No. It's probably just some viral thing passing through her system. But we'll do the bloodwork just to make sure, okay? Okay. - How was it? - It was a bit weird, but fine. - Why? What did he do? - Checked my blood. What, you had to get a needle? Yeah, just did that one, like, in here. - Ugh. - I know. Now it's just more wait, see now. Sounds like nothing. Trust in the doctors, Holly. They know more than you do. - Don't do that. - Do what? I know what you're doing and I'm asking you to stop. Should I come visit? - No, I'm fine. - You sure? I can make the time. Yech, you know what I mean? - Hmm? - No. - No. - I'll send some money, then. Get help with the cleaning. I told you, I don't need that. I'm fine. - I'm just trying to be helpful. - Thank you for offering. - Get a massage. You're so tense. - Okay, I have to go now. - Well, keep me in the loop, darling. - Bye, Mommy. - Granny says hi, sends hugs and kisses. - Hi, Granny. - You want some bread? - Mm-mm, no. Hey, babe. Do you wanna try just a tiny little bit? I'm not hungry. I thought maybe if we just start you off with a few simple things... Mom, can you pass the... Mm, yeah. Thank you. I don't really know what to do with you, Bets. You feel like you need to do something with me? I mean do for you. You know, don't play with my words, okay? Hmm. There. Five little, tiny, weeny peas. They're not gonna hurt you. I said I'm not hungry. Sweety, you can't just live on tea. It's not healthy. Here. Mom, I... she's just been to doctor's. Maybe she doesn't have to eat yet. Like, she doesn't feel well. Thank you, Izzy. That's so helpful. Please. Betsey, please. Hmm. There. Good, right? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah? Here, have some more. Bets? Bets? Bets! Izz, call an ambulance! Isabelle! Are you calling? - Quick! - Yes! Um, ambulance! Betsey, come on, breathe! I'm so sorry! Um, uh... 1050 Mulligan Street. - Darling. - No, she's calming down now. I'm so sorry. Um, uh, she's just lying with my mom. Dr. Foster, please come to surgery. Dr. Foster, please come to surgery. I'd recommend any of the names on this list just to explore some possibilities. Okay. Hey, Bets. Yeah? We'll figure this out, okay? - Okay. - We will, trust me. What if there isn't anything to figure out, though? You're not crazy. There's something going on, and we will find out what it is. - Mom. - Hmm? What if this is just me now? - What do you mean? - Well, I don't know. I... I think... What? Some people are just destined for stuff, right? Like, some people are just special like that? This is not your destiny. Bets, you can be whatever you want. You can be anything. That's it. I'm gonna go and put these in your bathroom, okay? Okay. I'll get it! No, I'll go. - Dominic, hey. - Hi, Mrs. Hughes. Look at you! Your hair! I know, it's grown, hasn't it? - I'm so glad you came. - Yeah, me too, me too. - You look lovely. - Oh. - Oh, she's... she's in her room. - Thank you, thank you. Hey. - Shoes. - Yep. Sorry. Bets? Hey. Boo. So, are you dying or something? Close the door. Stop, stop it. No, you stop. Stop pointing and laughing. I'm telling you. - You're lying. - No, no, obviously. Oh, hi, Mom. Hey. So nice to hear you laugh. Thanks. - Mom, Mom, I need to... - Of course, yeah, sorry. What? Can I tell you something? Are you leaving already? Yeah. - You're not hungry? - No, thank you. Really nice seeing you. Hey. What are you doing? Just thought I'd give Isabelle some things. Hey. Dominic didn't stay long. Did you have a fight? I didn't. He might have. Hey. Hey, come here. It will get better. Just wait and see. You're my special girl, Bets. Hey. Hey. Everything okay? Yeah, um... Betsey's gonna give you some of her clothes. Supper's in an hour. Here. I mean, I've basically been leading, like, my whole secondary school education up until this. It's not even fair 'cause kids who are year 11 now - got to do it last year. - Hmm? Apparently, just 'cause one boy took it too far, they're not even gonna let us do it this year. - Okay, what? - I said, apparently, just 'cause one boy took it too far, they're not even gonna let us do it this year. - Who told you that? - Everyone knows, everybody. - Can you stop waving your spoon around? - Mom, it's important! It's tradition. Betsey got to do it. Right, Bets? Bets? Hmm? Can we just have a nice supper? - I'm not hungry. - Not funny. I'm not trying to be funny. Is this because I stopped your allowance this week? It's 12 pounds. Yeah, I'm sure I'll manage. Maybe she's just not hungry. Do you know there are families in the world that have nothing? They have nothing. They have to eat cats! Cats? It's not funny, Isabelle. Get up. - What? - Don't "what" me, get up. - Get up! - Mom! - Eat your food, please. - You're hurting me! I have tried really hard with you. - I have listened. - Mom! - Mom, stop! - Stay there! For you, it's one thing, it's your body. I... I don't like it, but it is your body. But you do not... you do not infect this family with your ideas. - I'm not. - You are! Do you think it's funny? You're laughing at me. Is this like some little game? It's not a fucking game, Betsey! It's a sickness. You're sick! I'm not sick. Okay, people do not just stop eating. Do you know what it's called, hmm? It's anorexia. Do you know who gets it? Entitled, middle-class white girls. - I'm not anorexic! - You wait! Get on. Get on. Will you fucking get on the scale!? We are weighing you twice a day. "Betsey's weight." What's the, um... It's the 17th. Thank you. Once in the morning, once at night. Twice a day. - Hey, Granny. - Hello. - Hello, darling. - Hi, Mom. I'll put this in the kitchen. - Is she in her room? - Yeah. - Here, take a look at this. - Yeah, she's... Oh, hi, Granny June. Hello, you. What time do you call this? Were you planning on sleeping through lunch? How's your boyfriend? You mean John, do you, darling? John. Truth is, he bores me. Mom didn't say you were coming. Well, I heard you hadn't been feeling very well, so I thought I'd visit, check on you. - That's nice. - I thought so. Do you remember the summer you stayed with Granddad and me? Yes, you do. It was the first time you and your sister stayed overnight with us, remember? Granddad rented Harry Potter, thought you'd love it. - Oh, uh, yeah, maybe. - Your mother was livid. You had to sleep in their bed for weeks after that. Do you know she threatened never to leave you with me again? As if she was doing me a favor, dropping you terrors off at my house. You remember the morning after Potter-gate, don't you? I had work to do and I told you to go and find something to do outside. - No, I... I don't remember. - I do. Later, I made lunch and I came out to find you. That's when I heard you talking to someone. Who? I watched you, Betsey, for a good, long time. And you had no idea. That night, you tried to get into my bed. You came through, woke us both, and said you could hear something under your own bed. You were terribly upset, tears and everything. Granddad bought it, hook, line, and sinker, but I took you back to your room, to your own bed, and made you stay there until you fell asleep. I don't remember that either. Then you won't remember rehearsing the whole thing that morning. I watched you practice the routine in the garden. Word for word. You had it down to the tears. It was all a little act to get what you already knew you wanted. I rather admired you. "What a shrewd little performer she is," I thought. We've all got problems, darling. Don't be the show. Now, get up and come down for lunch. So, girls, what we'd like to do this week is a diary share, if you wouldn't mind. Julia, would you like to go first? Um, so, on Wednesday, I went around the grounds and... The days will be quite structured in the early weeks, but you'll find, with time, you'll gain freedom to make more choices. Please, Betsey, feel free to look around. Are there any restrictions on visits? Not outside of the designated therapy hours. - When are those? - It varies. Can we take her out for special occasions, holidays? Not without prior consent from the therapist, no. I've asked you really politely. I would have it on Saturday when I normally have it. I'll have it now. There's something obviously bothering you. Fuck you! Come on, now, count to 10. But you don't understand! It's important... - Let's go back inside. - It's the rules. I'm sorry, I can't. I don't care about the rules! - Bets. - It's the way it is. Just keep calm. - Betsey, come. - Stop following me! Damn it! They were right in here. I put them in the shitting bag so I wouldn't lose them. Maybe you left them in the office. I didn't leave them in the office. Maybe you... Good. Okay. - Mom. - Yeah? Can we go somewhere before we go home? This is where it all started. I was at the party, but I was in my head, you know? I was trying to think about what really interests me, the... the future and where I fit into it. I tried to imagine me leaving home, and Izzy growing up, and you getting old, but I... realized I just couldn't see it. Thinking about all that stuff just felt fake. I came outside for some air and that's when I felt it. I felt something calling me. And it brought me here and it showed me. I can feel what's coming for us. And it's just darkness, Mom, for everyone. It's okay, it's okay. Don't be scared. I've been chosen. - Oh, my love. - What? I didn't see it before, but I see now. - You're unwell. - I'm not unwell. It's a blessing. Well, we'll go back to the doctor, mm? And we're gonna tell him all of this, okay, mm? There's nothing wrong with me. We will find you a specialist that understands. You know, a psychiatric one, because what you're doing is very dangerous! - I'm not losing weight, Mom. - I know that, but I'm scared, okay? This isn't something you have a choice in, Mom. Neither of us do. Let's go, come on. Mom. Mom, if you don't support me, I'll have to leave. I will have you sectioned before I let you leave. - No, you won't. - I will. - But you won't. - I fucking will, Betsey! If you did that, I'd kill myself. Haven't you ever wondered what the point of everything is? You have to trust me, okay? How can you know this? It's like there was a hollow in me before, and... now it's been filled. I feel it. It's faith. It's been especially challenging this year, so I'm looking for some help. I appreciate your concern, but I am asking to withdraw the funds. Sir, I'm at my last resort. All of it. I need to withdraw all of it. So, how much is the fee? Thank you. Um, thank you very much for your help. Can we leave? Oh, hey. How was it, being back on the ice? Don't think I wanna do it anymore. Oh, Granny's there. - Hey, Granny. - Hello. How long have you been outside? Ages. I didn't know you were coming. Lovely to see you two. Izzy, can you go and check on Betsey, please? Do as your mother bids you, Isabelle. Are you thirsty? Yeah, sure. I'm surprised you didn't call ahead. I've called many times. You don't answer the phone, Holly. Are you hungry? I could make some hummus. I thought you couldn't leave her alone now. It's fine. She's in a dormant phase. I see, mm-hmm. A dormant phase. There are other rehab solutions to consider. Internationally renowned institutions. Doesn't have to be in the UK. You know money isn't an issue. Mmm, I'm not sending her away, Mom. Okay. But she does need professional care. Her GP checks on her weekly. And she has seen every specialist under the sun. Don't exaggerate. Oh, for God's sake, Holly. Bets? Do you remember that year we had in Osaka when I was teaching? You were six, I think. You gonna tell me a story, Mom? I was studying folklore. I remember being very caught up in comparative oral histories. It was a big thing back then, wonderful stories. Living stories. There's this particular one that keeps coming back to me, with Betsey being as she is. The Futakuchi-Onna. It's a ghost tale, really. A very old one. A poor farmer marries a beautiful young woman. The woman, of course, represents the ideal Japanese wife. Courteous, obedient, quiet. Perfect in every way except for one thing. She ever eats. Not a single grain of rice enters her mouth. So this begins to gnaw at the farmer. The mystery of it is hard for him to ignore. But what's worse is that his reserves are being depleted. It's as if he were feeding two instead of just himself. So one day, this peasant farmer plots to stay back from his fields to spy on his new bride. He does this and discovers the Futakuchi-Onna dining on his reserves, living on the back of his precious bride's head. A grotesque mouth hidden among her braided hair. Are you suggesting Betsey's been possessed by a demon? Quite the opposite, Holly. I believe Betsey's possessed this family. You most of all. Mom! Izzy? Okay Izzy, I'm coming! - Mom! - I... I'm coming! Mom! Hey! Oh, move. Go! Go, go, go. Bets? Bets? Baby? Honey, I'm here. Sometimes it's like... it's like she's completely gone. - Voices. - More like she taps out. She'll say those things and... she comes up with really dark stuff. Like what? Like talk about end of times or ideas of what she thinks is coming. She says she has to prepare. She has to serve or whatever. It's why she won't eat. That's her part in it all. She does this really scary thing where she stops breathing and the temperature drops and she's... she's like an icicle. What does the doctor say about that? Who are you talking to? Someone used to come once a week, but Betsey made them stop. She said they, like, get in the way of her work. - This is utterly ridiculous. - No, no, no, no. No, no. Just sit down. - Holly, what happened? - It was sort of a... a fit. - Honey, does it hurt? - Well, of course it hurts. - Look at her. - It's fine. Don't worry. It was an accident. It was an accident. I fell on the ice. You're lucky you didn't break your nose. First top and lower incisors are fine, but without the brace, her cross bite has advanced, as predicted. It's not causing her any pain, though, is it? Any headaches? - Neck aches? - No. Well, we just have to keep an eye on the crowding. When am I gonna see big sister? She's overdue. Yeah, I must get her in. - Uh, Holly. - Yes? Is everything okay? Yes, fine, fine. I wonder, would you like to review your payment plan? Your last two months are outstanding and with Betsey missing appointments... I am so sorry. I had this issue with online banking. And I just... I will sort it out this afternoon. Thank you. Thank you so much. Of course. How was it? Yeah, it was fine. God, stop! What've you done? What are you doing? Betsey! Take your hands off. No, no, no, darling. Darling, breathe, please. Izzy! Izzy, help! Izzy! God, please help me! Don't! Stop! Darling. No, no, no! - Mom? - Izzy, help me! Mom what's she doing to herself? You were supposed to watch her! Betsey, just breathe, breathe. I see the stars. And what else? The stars. They pour out of eyes and mouths, and they burn it all. What do they burn? Everything. It's inside all of us. Stars. Light. Purpose. I can feel it. I can feel it, I can feel it, I can feel it, I can feel it. - I can feel the end. - Go on. And then what? Dark! Darling. Shh, shh, shh. Shh, it's okay. It's okay. - Hi, Mom. - Hey. Betsey. Where's all this coming from? - Hi, Gran. - Why are you doing this? Doing what? Oh, Bets. Tell us what's wrong. Don't worry, Granny. This'll all be over really soon. When, Betsey? There's still time. Mom's still searching for it. I want you all to know this hope. This feeling. Dad says that he's sorry. What? What... what did you say? - Betsey, how... - There's no time. Betsey, no, what did you just say? Betsey, Betsey, please, please. Did you just say... Holly, surely you can see this is getting seriously out of control. I'm worried about both of you. You're a mess. Isabelle's a nervous wreck and Betsey's all... Betsey's what? She's disturbed. I mean, I can see she's convinced herself of this fiction, but you're... What am I? You're going along with it. It's time we get you both help. I don't want your kind of help. What does that mean? I don't want to send my daughter away to get fixed. To get pumped full of lithium till all the lights go out. With not one visit. You were very ill. I did what was recommended. I did my very best. Well, it wasn't good enough! I want you to go. I don't want you here. Please tell Isabelle she's welcome to come and stay with me if she needs a break. Bets? Bets? Betsey, what is this? Ew! Bets? - So, your sister. - Hmm? Does she, like, fucking walk around with her eyes shut or some shit? - No. - Well, she's like a sorcerer, isn't she? No. A sorcerer is like an old guy with a beard off Game Of Thrones or some shit, you dickhead. Fuck off. Dom dated her. He said she thinks she's some sort of... fucking prophet or some shit. Does Dom still text her? - Izzy. - Hmm? Here. Suck it like a straw. No, you gotta do it again if you wanna get high. - Come on, one more set. Come on, come on! - Yeah, yeah. Yes! - Yes! Finally, finally. - Took your time, though. - Hey. - Hi. My shoes. - Is it your girlfriend? - No. It's Dom. The fuck are you doing? Are you stupid, Caleb? Get up. Are you all right? - Yeah? - Yeah. You sure? I'm gonna... I'm gonna take you home, okay? What? Are you gonna... It's all right, it's all right. Just let it out. There we go. You okay? Oh, Mrs. Hughes, I am so sorry. I had no idea Caleb had alcohol. I know that's not a good enough excuse, but... ah, he's just a cheeky shit. What did she say to you? What, Izzy? No, no. Betsey. Right, you were here and then you left. We haven't seen you. Oh. What did she say to you? Shit. Dominic, sit down. You know, she just... she just told me that she wasn't eating. That she didn't want to. And then she just said she wasn't coming back to school. And then she told me what happens in the end, Mrs. Hughes, about the stars, and how we need to reset. She told me the reason she's been chosen is because you're the first star and she has to prepare you. Do you pray, Dominic? Yes, Mrs. Hughes. Does it work? I don't think that's the point, Mrs. Hughes. Eat. Oh, God, please, wake up. Wake up. Wake up! We need your help! Wake up! Just, please, just... Betsey, please! Please, please! You need to wake up, please! Please, please, just eat it. Please! Izzy, stop! Mom, I'm scared. I am so scared of what's gonna happen next. Izzy, no, you stop that! - Please, just eat it. - Izzy. - Please! Oh, please. - Shush. Shush, now. It's okay. Get off me. Get... Get off. This is so fucked up! Mom? Hey. Hey, babba. It's just for the weekend. - Yeah? - Yeah. I love you so much. She's your special girl, right? What? No, no. Yeah, thing is, um, I mean, if she's right, like, you know, this, me, you, Dad, Gran, you know, it's... it's nothing. I mean, everything is just meaningless if it goes away. - No, you mustn't think that. - She's lying, then. I don't know. But either way, she showed me. What, what? What did she show you? Showed me what it's like to be nothing. Gran, I'm gonna play outside. Darling? Don't worry, she'll be fine. I wanted to apologize. They're your daughters and I know how much you love them. You're a very good mother. I was just pregnant when we decided to buy this house, and we walked in here and he said, "This is Betsey's room." And if he were here now, then he would know what to do. He was so bloody confident. It was so good because it meant I didn't have to be. I could just be me. I didn't have to pretend to hold it all together. I don't want to pretend to be that person anymore. I just want it all to be over. I don't want to be in control. I just... I just want to let go of everything. It's in a week. A... a new world for all of us. A new way of life, a fresh start. But the heat will consume everything and the stars will burn it all so that our work can finally start again. It's okay, it's okay. You don't have to be scared. You don't have to be afraid, because I've seen what happens afterwards. It's so beautiful. So beautiful. I'm gonna need you, Mom. Okay, I'll need you. I've seen now what it's gonna be. I'm gonna need you to help me, okay? That's your purpose. That's what I've seen for you. That's why you're my mom. Your love is key to all of this, okay? Do you understand? And I know that you've suffered. And I know that Isabelle has too, and I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I can't wait for you to see what comes after this because then you can finally know that it's all worth it. Okay? Then you can finally believe me. But I need you to promise, Mom, okay? I need you to promise because I'm gonna say things. And I'm gonna be really, really tempted to give up, but you can't let me, okay? You have to be strong. - I will try. - No. You have... You have... you have to promise. - You have to promise. - I promise. Really, really promise? I do, I do, I promise you. Why are you doing this to me? Why, Mom, are you doing this to me? - Stop it! - Oh, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts! No, you are strong, baby. I lied, I lied, I lied, I lied! - No, love, be strong! - Mommy, please! Yes! No, I need an ambulance! I need a fucking ambulance! Mom, I need help, I need help, I need help! Please? God, Jesus. - I need help! - Jesus Christ. Stop it! Stop it! No, I'm not strong enough.
