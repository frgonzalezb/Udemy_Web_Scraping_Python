foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Hey! Move those boxes. Hurry up! Are you guys done or what? Come on, boys! "A small catch today, a big one tomorrow.‚Äù That's what they say, right? Go home and eat your vegetables. Can you give me a hand here? Come on, Elliott! Good work today, guys. Unfortunately, the ocean was still asleep. - Yet again? - Isn't that what they say? No, just you. Use that energy at sea and you might get a full envelope. Let's make it interesting. Come on. I'm out. - Are you for real? - Not ready to lose a day's wages, are ya? Shut up, man. And tell Oliver he still owes me from last time. If he doesn't pay up, I'll fucking kill him! Wanna grab something to eat? No, I'm good, thanks. Oliver's got this gig tonight, and I, uh... I promised him I'd play guitar. Are you sure about that guy? I thought you were done with that. It's okay. See you tomorrow. Put some oil on that chain. Hey! What the hell, man? Where were you? - Huh? - Well, I have a job. Rings a bell? You know how much ass I had to kiss to get this gig, huh? I mean, I thought that was your thing. - How do I smell? - No, piss off, moron. All right? That's... That's Suzanne Taylor in there. Vince Taylor's widow. And Patrick, the guy who produced his biggest hits. They could get me on the largest stage in the whole country. You understand? - Yeah, I do. - You sure? You got the money? Tonight is a very special night. Here you go. Two thousand. - Thanks. - Hey. The two of us, okay? We own that stage tonight. We're gonna go up there and fucking kill it.

And congratulations! - Cheers, and thanks for coming. - Hey! - Thanks for being here tonight. - Yep. Yep. Huge opportunity for me. - It's gonna happen, man. - Great. I'm ready. Okay. Good evening, everybody. Good evening. You look amazing. My name is, uh, Oliver. And Suzanne... - This song is for you. - Thanks. Hey! You can't just leave now. We have to find out if she liked it. Whatever, Oliver. Just go back in there and ask her. No, I want you there with me, dammit. Hey! I thought you were singing tonight. Seriously? Okay, I fucked up. And you saved my ass in there, and you were awesome. Okay? What the hell's your problem? - My problem? - Yeah. Getting me on stage in front of all those fucking people, and then leave me hanging. - Calm down. - Looking like a fool, saving your ass. - 'Cause you don't know your shit. - Calm down. - This was your fucking job. - Okay, will you calm down? Okay? - It's you and me. - Is it, really? Yeah, it is. Hey. I would die for you, okay? You're my best friend. - Shut the fuck up, you know it's bullshit. - You shut up. If we've got nothing to die for... what the hell are we doing? - Huh? - Good night. Come on, man. Would you look at that. It's Bert and Ernie. What's up, bros? - Just fuck off, Dennis! - Shut up, man! - Girls night out? Hello! - Fuck! I've been trying to call you all day, man. What's going on? - I don't know. - You don't know? - Nothin'. - Nothing? You play cards with me, then you lose. Then you don't pay what you owe. What's up with that? You spend all your dad's money? - Maybe I have a look at your watch. - Nice watch. - Fuck off, man! - Okay, man, you're a tough guy, huh? - Bold move. - You wanna get your ass kicked? Dennis. You know what? Grab him! Fucking grab him! Hey! Let him go! No, Elliott! Elliott, stop! Did I ruin your birthday party? You know who my husband was, right? Twenty-two years at number one. Sixteen platinum records. Better sales figures than the rest of the top ten together. Wow. Good for him, huh? The song you sang tonight, which one of you wrote it? I did. You know, I haven't heard anything that good since he died. What do you want? Why are you here? I can get you out of here. But, um... you would have to agree to just spend time with me. Ten thousand kroner a week. Just come by and hang out. We'll see how it goes. See you tomorrow. You've reached Oliver. Don't leave a message. Hello? It's me. Yeah. What's going on? Why are you not picking up? What's going on? What the hell do you think, Elliott? I'm in Hamburg, okay. That's what's going on. At my dad's office. He forced me to come down here after your fucking stunt. I was just trying to help you out, man. Help? Okay. Super helpful. Great friend. I told you to leave him alone. Didn't I? Now I'm here, and my dad knows I have a gambling debt with those fucking losers because of you. Don't call me again. Okay. Ollie? Hey. What the hell are you doing? - I thought we were done with that shit. - Done with what now? Dennis had to stay home, and his face looks like a massive fish cake. - Yeah, he didn't like the show. - Listen. If you go to jail, you can't work for me. You'll lose the boat and be stuck here. She offered me a job. - Who? - Suzanne. - Why the hell are you still here, then? - Because fuck that bullshit. - I don't wanna work for her. - Probably pays a little more than I do. You could use it on the boat. Or buy me something. I could use a new truck. Or a foxtail for your antenna? Get those boxes in the truck. Yeah. Over there. Holy shit, it's a freaking mansion. What are we dropping off here? You. You're kidding, right? - You are kidding, right? - No. You know I'm not. Now get your ass out of my truck, and get in there. Look at me. Elliott. I'll be 48 soon. And I'll be lugging boxes until my legs give way, you know. But not you. You got a chance, and it's in there. - The fuck it is. - Yes, it is. - No. - Yep. - Nah. - Sure, it is. Now piss off, man. You're fired. You can't just fire me. Yeah? Well, I just did. No, the fuck you did. Out! - Are you being serious right now? - Yeah. Your old legs are gonna miss me, you know that? I'll have to get prosthetics. You're a jerk, man. Where are you going? I'm leaving. I'm going back to London. I... I've got a lot of stuff to do. You just got here. I mean... We didn't get to talk yet. Patrick asked me to come. Okay? It was good to see you. Happy birthday. There's no job waiting for you in London, is there? I talked to John. He hasn't seen you in months. I haven't either. Where have you been? See ya. Lilly. Hi, Elliott. Come in. Glad you could make it. What's he doing here? I just promised Julie down at the police station that I'd bring him here and make sure he behaves. Well, don't look at me. Let's see what happens. Maybe he can make some music while he's here. You could stay, maybe. Produce it. I should have expected that. You heard the same thing I heard. What I heard, I've heard before. He has no schooling, no direction. He's a drunken fisherman with a guitar. No offense. But he can sing. And he can write. And you're the best producer I know. This is great. - Is there anything I can do, or...? - You can stop being such a smart-ass. And then you can start doing whatever she says. Okay? Let's see what he's got. If it doesn't work out, there's another flight on Monday. Is that what you want to do? No. Why are you here, then? I'm here for the money. Get a guitar. All right. Play. Play what? Whatever you feel like. Can I switch guitars? Mm-hmm. Ugh. Good morning. Birthday kid. - Morning. - I got completely shitfaced last night. What the hell's he doing here? Su, no! I mean... What's going on? She needs to succeed at something. Sure, Suz, I... I get that. I do. I think they could achieve something. - If we just help them. - Sure, but... Su, that boy? I mean... Uh, he's no Vince Taylor. Come on. No one is. All right. You got her to come. And you want her to stay. Don't you know any other songs? Sure. - Yeah? - Yeah. Have you written any other songs? - Mm-hm. Plenty. - Okay. Then play one of them. - What? - What's that song called? It's called "Original." Okay. I think that's the most unoriginal song I've ever heard. Okay. You heard, like, eight seconds of it. That's why. Hmm. You can sing. But sing something that means something to you. Something that brings you joy or, uh, brings you sorrow. Hmm. Shoulda just said that. Hmm? Let's call it a day. Yeah, you're welcome. I had a great day too. Morning. You waited long? Four hours, damn it. I've been waiting for four hours. Ah. Why are you here? Why are you? Because my mom thinks you're unique. I don't think that. I think this is a waste of time. Mine and yours. - Okay. So why are you here? - I ask myself the same thing. Maybe because in a moment of weakness, I thought there could be a shed of talent hidden underneath that smart-ass attitude of yours. I'm sure you think you're so amazing, right? How's it going? He can sing. But he's scared. He's trying to keep me at arm's length. He keeps himself at arm's length. But he's got something. Actually, I meant to ask how you're doing. Fine. I guess I'm fine. - Lilly, can't we try... - Stop. He can't create here. It's Vincent Taylor's studio, and that stresses him out. It's just... there's this... weight. It's intimidating. What are you thinking? Do you live here? No. I just dropped by without my shirt on. Listen. If we're gonna do this... we gotta do it right. No more bullshit. Get dressed. Come on. Hey. Get your hands off my radio. You listen to that? That is Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor. Yeah, I listen to that. Rach-what now? ...maninoff. Rachmaninoff. That's a cool name. I'll give you that. - D minor. - C minor. There is a chance it was composed in C. But this part right here, D minor. Listen. - I'm all ears. - Are you? What about you, Elliott? How long have you been singing? Always, I think. As long as I can remember. - Since I was a kid. - Did you play in a band? Or take classes? No... I guess I just play... whatever I hear. - Hmm. - I think. How come a man with your voice is sorting lobsters down at the docks? It's because people like you are paying stacks for it. Well. Touch√©, huh? It doesn't matter who you are. What really does is who you become. Mm. So, um... what's the, uh... the plan? Make a demo. That's easy. We have a bridge. A bridge is not a song. We need verses and a chorus. It'll come. - So, uh... - Patrick has at least ten in his drawer. Am I producing it, or are you? - Barbecue. A little more barbecue. - Oh, Patrick. You're a magician! - There we go. Careful. - Oh, looks amazing. Would you like some? Okay. Let's dive in. It was so fucking crazy, bro. The stadium was really packed. It was so... It was almost like a riot in there. And there were as many people outside who hadn't gotten tickets. And Vince was in the zone. He went flat out for the next three hours. I mean, nonstop. And we... the idiots we were, standing at the airport. We just... we stood there and waited for him. Remember that, Lilly? We were supposed to fly back to Europe. Remember that? What were you, like, 14, 15, right? - No. I was nine. - Nine? No. Sure, I turned ten the next day. That's why we had to go home. So we're waiting at the airport, but he never showed. He went to a park in the middle of the city. And he sang a full-on concert for all those people outside the stadium. All night. We didn't leave until the next day. After that, he took his car and drove straight to a huge gig in Berlin. On my tenth birthday. Yeah, he was very... dedicated. This life requires prioritizing work and performing under pressure. Your father understood that. I'm sure you do too. Did you listen to Dad's songs? They became shitty 'cause he prioritized work so long. - He lost himself along the way. - You can't live this life and have family. Sure you can. But you just have to be up for it. - He made his choices, you know. - Sure, but you never stopped him. - Lilly. - Not when he left us on my birthday. Not when he left for three years without us, and not when he jumped. Lilly. Good morning. You always fell asleep that. Where were you that night? I heard you got a lot of calls... from his hotel room's phone, and yet... - Listen... - Why didn't you answer? Lilly... - Good morning. - Good morning. Could you just play the first verse? Did you add this guitar? Hey! That's cool. You just did this now? Yeah. - Awesome. - Let's start with the bridge. - The bridge? Okay. - Okay? Sick. Ooh. It's great. Great job. Both of you. - Do you have the chorus? - No. It'll come when he's ready. The next step is get some offers from a record company. Best way to do that is to show we have an audience. Right. Let's just post the song on all profiles and platforms and, uh, take it from there. - Hmm? - I don't have any profiles. No. Vince has four million followers. There's been no new posts ever since he died. - Your song will be the first. - That's genius, Suz. Okay, we're gonna do a live recording of you singing the song to the camera and... then we'll post it and link it to the demo. A "live recording", what do you mean? - A recording where you sing the song... - You said ten thousand for a week. So I wouldn't be arrested. "Come and hang out." Right? What did you expect? I mean, you think this is some kind of holiday? Enjoy yourself, get free food and lodging. We're not joking around. Fuck this. - Great. - Lil... Lilly. Elliott. Elliott. - Did you know about this? - No. I know she says some crazy things sometimes. Whatever, this is bullshit. Elliott, I know you're having a tough time. Sure, the little rich girl from the Taylor family, you know exactly what I'm dealing with. You think you're the only one in the world who's had a fucked-up life? Huh? - Shut up! - You feel so fucking sorry for yourself. You're only alone in this world because you don't have the guts to put yourself out there. You don't know a thing about me. I know you're a coward, wasting your talent because you're afraid. Who do you sing for when you sing? A song doesn't just exist. It comes to life. Between two people. One who sings and one who listens. Whether you're here in the studio or, uh, in a big, packed stadium with thousands of fans... you're not performing for nothing. You have to choose a person or... you have to imagine there's someone you're singing to. Someone you're singing for. If you're not singing for anyone, then... Then it's all the same. Then, the song doesn't exist. Then you don't exist. Suz, uh... Honestly, I don't know. I think he's a nobody. We've all been there. Well... Is she okay? No idea. Are you okay? Hm? Holy fucking shit, bro. What the hell was that, man? Pardon my French, bro! Come here. I fucking love this shit. Thank you. What the fuck just happened, man? Awesome, bro. Hot. Hey, we're back in business. Hi, I'm Elliott Winther, and I... um... No, bro. A little, uh, more cheery. Um... Bro, come on. Uh, so... Give me a little more... a little more confidence, okay? You're the star, goddammit. Okay? 'Kay, take it from the top. A little more confidence. 'Kay, bro. Hi, I'm Elliott Winther, and I hope this song is for you. Watch your head. It's beautiful. It was my dad's. When was this? I was seven. It was the last time I saw 'em. What happened to them? They hit the open sea... There was a storm... That was it. Yeah. It was kept on land for ten years while I lived... other places. What other places? With foster families... a few children's homes... I guess I wasn't... What's the term? Good-tempered? And you haven't sailed since? I'm saving up. And, um... I'll get it out there. Soon. - Hopefully. - Okay. Where to? Around the world. What for? Because my parents couldn't. It's not as great as people think, traveling around the world. New people, new languages, new places... Again and again. Just like that, your whole life. That much effort just to follow a father who wasn't even there. Is that why you have that French accent? I don't have a French accent. How did he die? Your dad? He committed suicide. Jumped off the balcony of a hotel. After a concert. - Shit. - Mm-hmm. Do you remember them? Yeah. They would always sing to me. Music everywhere, always, you know? We'd compete on who could sing the loudest. My dad never sang to me. He sang to the world. But never to me. - Ah. Stop it. Don't look at me like that. - What? - Huh? How? - Stop. - I'm not doing anything. - You are. I hope you like, uh, baked beans. - Are they hot? - Should they be? Rise and shine. Sup, kids? There's a new king in town, baby. - Hi, darling. - Hi. Hi, what're you up to? Huh? We're having breakfast. Oh, you're having breakfast, huh? Super romantic, right? - Hey. - Mm... Bro, what the... - Holy shit. What is this? - It's baked beans. Those are not baked beans. It's a baked asshole. What the fuck? Okay, you won't be eating this anymore. You know why? "This Song Is For You..." isn't just for you, Lilly. It got over 500,000 views since yesterday. It's trending at number one on YouTube. It's gone viral on TikTok. You're smashing the shit out of the shit, brother. What does, um... What does that mean? Goldilocks, it means you're a fucking star, bro. - You're full of shit. You're kidding. - Nah, I'm not full of shit. Nah, bro, it's true. You did this, Lilly. - It's a done deal. - What?! Yeah. We have an album to make, okay? Come on. You cute fucks. We're on a roll. Yes! - Hell yeah! - What the fuck? Are you ready? And again at number one, for the 5th week in a row, former fisherman turned pop star. You've definitely heard of him. This is Elliott with "I Hope This Song Is For You." You know him from TikTok, from Instagram, you've seen him on YouTube. "I Hope This Song Is For You." Huge hit. Exploded out of the stratosphere. This has got to be every man's dream, right? It's crazy. I mean, to be honest, I don't even know... I don't even know what's going on here. - What the fuck are you doing here? - Come here. - Ahh! - I couldn't abandon my best friend, right? Shit, you look great, man. - What about your dad? - Fuck him. Now we're gonna live it up, right? Okay. Rock star. - You comin'? - No, I think I'm gonna... It's fine. Have fun. Come on. Hey, come on. Shit man, you gotta air this place out, huh? Shit... - It's on the house, my friend. - Wait, really? Damn, on the house? Hell yeah, bruh! Holy cow, man! You're a freakin' stud, huh? Whoo! So, what's up with that Lilly girl? - What about her? - What about her? Is she good? Huh? - Is she fit? - Sure, she's fit. She's fit? - Yeah, she's fit. But she's... she's... - Yeah? She's got skills, Ollie. She's got skills? What kinda skills? - Shut the fuck up. - How skilled? Shut up, man. You're kidding, man, skills? Yeah, right! So tell me... How the hell'd you get here? I mean, did she reach out to ya? Suzanne? When? After the gig. My job? I gotta run, Ollie. No, no, no. Come on. Stay, man, Stay, I mean... - We just got here. What're you doing? - I'm singing tomorrow. Look at all the pussy coming my way when you're around. - It's crazy, man. - Cut it out, man. Right? You're a huge star. Folks love you, man. Huh? And I've always known it. Always. I've always said it. I'm just happy everyone can see it now. Mwah! You're a fucking rock star! Come on, cheers. Nah, would you look at that. Holy shit, man. It's your song. - Thank you, DJ. That's the shit! - Oliver. - Sit down. - They're playing your song. We own this place, dude. Hey! He's here, ladies and gentlemen. Elliott Winther. - The king, Elliott Winther. - Oliver! Get your ass down! Hey! Come here! Would you like something to drink? - Yeah, you two. - This is embarrassing. Chill out! Hey, girls... - These two go well together. - Sure, they are spot on. - Yeah. - They should do the job. Hi, guys. - I think so too. - Hi. - Uh, hi. - Sorry we're late. - It's Oliver's fault. - Shut up. Nah. - It is, though. - Uh, hi. Hi, there. Hi. That looks sick. What is that? Well, uh, we have a lot of things to talk about. - Yeah. - Confidentially. Sure. - That's fine. - I won't say anything. Okay. Well. Several companies are interested, so... we have to make an album in a hurry. What do we have? We have seven out of ten songs. I think you and Lilly can do the last three, and then, in the meantime, I'll arrange some interviews. Okay. That's insane. All right. We hired two social media consultants to run your TikTok, Snapchat, Insta, and Facebook. They'll manage your pages, reply to comments for you. - Patrick... - Yes. That, bro. Your shoes, your clothes... custom-made. And there's your stage, your set design, and we keep it all blue, we think. Fuck, this looks awesome! - And then there's your shoot as well. - Right. We think... these three are awesome. - Right? - Yeah. Now we just have to pick an album cover for you, so... - What do you think? - Hm? Um... I mean, I think, um... Yeah... I don't really know. - Isn't... isn't this a bit, uh... - A bit what? You look angry, you know. I love that one. The blue one, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's awesome, if you want your balls to be the star. - Bro, we can't even see your face in this. - Band's been waiting since nine, so Lilly... Yeah, ready when Elliott is. Well, I'm ready. Let's get started. Go with this one. I think it's cool. Works well with that one. - Awesome. - Elliott? Yeah? It's fine. He's gonna hang out for a bit. Yeah, bruh, this is fucking great. Damn, that guy... Fucking pain in the ass. Fuck, that's so good, man. It's fucking crazy. He's insane, man. - So fucking good, right? - Can you sit down? - Huh? - I'm trying to work. I... Okay, I'm just saying that... that, uh... Right. You're here 'cause Elliott wants you here. I actually would prefer if you weren't. Do you understand? What? Come on, have a seat. Damn! How did you like that? - Hey! - Hi. What's up? - Cool, right? - Mm-hm. Can you stay and do a couple extra vocal takes? Why? - You missed a couple beats. - Come on. Can't you get Patrick to Melodyne it, tune it yourself or somethin'? Huh? Yeah, yeah. I'm coming. - Fuck's sake. Hey. - Hm. I'll see you later, okay? What's going on? - Are you a saint now or something? - I'm not a saint. Then why, man? That girl was ready for a threesome. She really was. You jerk! Come here. I missed you, man. I have. Ugh. Fucking Hamburg, man. What the hell can I do there? Huh? I have to be here. You and me, man. The two of us. All that talk... our dreams and stuff. I just have to be here. It's... It's been rough, money-wise. - Money-wise? - Mm. What about your dad? - He closed the account. - What? He was pissed 'cause I left the office or whatever. - He'll come around, right? He's your dad. - Shut up about my dad. Just cut it out, will ya? Okay? I don't wanna talk about him now. Is there anything I can do? - Or we can do? - Mm-mm. You don't have that kinda money. - What do you need, bro? - Hm? Nothing. Nothin'? Hey. Where you are... what you've got going now... - That was ours, wasn't it? - Ollie... - How do I become part of it? - Stop. - We're friends. - It doesn't work like that. We're good friends, right? - It doesn't work that way. - Doesn't it? So how does it work? Elliot? Can you just take other people's words and use them in your songs? Is that how it works? That's what you've done. "If you've got nothing to die for, what are you even alive for?" - Come on, that's my motto, isn't it? - Stop it, man. "If we have nothing to die for, what the hell are we doing?" - Isn't that what I told you? - You don't mean that. Yeah I do, actually. I do, actually. Get me on the album. I wrote all those songs. You never wrote a song in your life, not as much as a fuckin' line. - And I saved your ass that night. - You stole my words, dammit! You don't get it, do you? Who the fuck would you be if it wasn't for me, huh? Where would you be right now? On the docks. I was the one who got you that gig. I paid for you to be there. You wouldn't have shit if it wasn't for me. I mean, the least you could do is make me a part of it! You're living my life, dammit! Do you understand? That's my dream, man. What the fuck's wrong with you? Seriously. What the hell? Fuck you. One. One song. Then we forget all this, man. Water under the bridge. One song. You can do that. - Okay, bro. - Yeah? Yep. We're gonna roll it again, okay? - Just relax, from the top. Yep. - Yeah, yeah, okay. Totally. Cool. All right. It doesn't work. Doesn't work. Definitely not. One more time, Ollie. Again. We're having some technical issues in here. Get it together. - Ollie, come on. - Yeah? - What's going on? - From the top. Bro, we don't have time for this. Bullshit. Again! Jesus Christ, that sucked. Fuck! - Hey, can I just... - Can't you do anything? - Tune him or something? - No, I can't. Come on... Bro, he's not just out of tune. I could... mute him. You know? I could... I could, uh... replace his ass with a real fucking singer. You know? It doesn't work. We don't have time for this, bro. Come on. Elliott... can you just... - Again, Ollie. Let's go. - Hey... I want him out. What the hell is he doing here? Oliver is his only friend. What can I do, huh? Suzanne! You can't just run him and his music through a kind of template. That only works for some people. He has to put himself in it. Otherwise, it goes badly... "Some people." He's not Dad. You can't make him into Dad. Dad is gone. I gave you this task because I thought you could handle it. If you can't do it, then I will. - He's not ready! - Sure, okay. But your job was to get him ready! My job here is to set him free to become who he needs to be. And give him a long life of music. And if you squeeze him through the machine, he won't get through it. And then we both know how it ends. Apparently, you did all you could do. It's fine. Just go ahead and quit as you always do when things get difficult. Go back to London. Maybe John will give you another chance. Or wherever else you'd rather be than with your family. Ouch! Holy shit. Thanks a lot, X Factor. Okay. Suzanne, gimme another chance, will you? Get home safely, Oliver. Sit down. - You think I'm a fucking amateur? - No. You know what's at stake here, don't you? Everything. In 48 hours you'll be standing on Skanderborg's main stage in front of 48,000 people. And you'll be the first Dane ever to perform on Rocket in London. Do you realize what that TV show can do for you? That show will open the door to the rest of the world for you. If you do a good job, the world will be your oyster. And what you're dealing with, all that crap? All of it will go away. Hm? Or you can choose your friendship with that idiot and pack lobsters at the docks. Until you're killed in a fight some day. Nobody will be at your funeral, because no one will know who you are. Or... you can be a star. And the whole fucking world will know you. Tough choice, huh? Piss off, man. Don't waste my time. Get out. Elliott. - There's something I need to say. - Yeah? What do you wanna say? That the songs aren't good enough? Is that it? Or I can't hang out with Oliver, or... I can't go on tour because I'm not ready? I'm pregnant. Um... Say something, will you? I can't. No. No! No, I have to get in there. - You can't. - You need to stand back. - You can't. Elliott. - No! Get off me! - Hey, calm down, calm down. - Get off me! - No... - Calm down, Elliott. - There's nothing you can do. - We need you to calm down. - Dad! - Calm down. It's stuff. - They're in there. - No one's in there, Elliott. No! No! Elliott! Elliott! Elliott! Elliott! Hello, you've reached Lilly. Please leave a message after the beep. Hey, Lilly, it's John. So glad you decided to join us! Amazing work you've done with Elliott. Um... we have a studio ready, and a line of top artists just dying to work with you. Welcome to London. Elliott! Elliott! Elliott! Elliott! Elliott! Elliott! Oi, mate! Where is the amp, man? I gotta bring it up! We're here, bro. Everything... we've worked for... depends on you nailing this song. It's make or break, baby. I can't do it. - Sure, you can. - No, I can't. - You can do this, bro. Shh, hey. - No, I can't. You can do this. Since I met you guys... I've lost my best friend... my job... - My boat, my fucking home. - Okay. So stop talking to me like I'm a fucking child! Okay. Fine. That's good. What else? - Shut up. Shut the fuck up! - What? Hey. Hey, look at me. I never had a family of my own. You understand? Just like you. All I have is music. Bro... I gambled everything on this, okay? I... I'm not, um, a st... a star like you, I mean... No way. But I have the music. And I have my family. They are my family. You know what? They're your family, too, man. - My family died a long time ago. - No. Don't say that. Suz is your family. I'm your family. You and Lilly? You two are family now too. Do you understand that? Can you get that into your head? Hey. We've all lost something. We have. But there's one thing that's worse than that. It's losing the fear of losing again. Don't lose it. Okay? What are you doing here? I didn't answer the phone the night your dad called 'cause... the other time I did... twice, actually, he had girls over. I was afraid that if I picked up the phone, then... he'd say it was over. So I let it ring. Why didn't you say so? Because you loved him. So I couldn't do it. It wasn't Dad calling you. That night. It was me. From his hotel room. - I went there to look for him. - Lilly. But I didn't make it in time. And the only thing I could think of... The only thing I needed... was my mother. But you weren't there. And I've... missed him so much. I miss you so much, Mom. My darling. Welcome to Rocket. The show that finds the brightest and the shiniest new stars from all across Europe, and then propels them into musical eternity. Now tonight, we are honored to have with us a very special guest. In fact, it's our first artist from the small country of Denmark. So please, put your hands together and welcome the one, and the only, Mr. Elliott Winther. Elliott Winther, ladies and gentlemen. - Hello, sir. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I think they quite like you, uh, judging by that. So... Elliott, well, all I can really say is, uh... Well, wow! What a journey you are on. Yeah, it's been, uh... It's been pretty wild. I mean, do you sometimes feel you're still on the boat? Nah. My boat burned down, actually. Well, I'm just saying that because up until recently you were working as a fisherman, weren't you? Over in Denmark? But, uh... Well, now look at you. Look at how far you've come. Look at this young man. - Ladies and gentlemen, please. Huh? - I'm still a fisherman. You're still a fisherman. Yeah, well... You're gonna get some really big catches, I can see that... in your career, Elliott. Now, you're here tonight to play us your breakthrough hit, aren't you? It's a love song which is racing up the charts. And because it's a love song, Elliott, it kind of naturally begs the question, which is... is there anybody special in your life? Ooh... I mean, uh... who did you write this song for? When you play and sing this song, is there anybody in particular you, uh... you think about? - Elliott? - I mean... I wrote it for all of you guys! Yeah... Yeah. Well, all us guys are really excited to hear this song, Elliott. So, please, give it up for Elliott Winther and his very own, "I Hope This Song Is For You". What's he doing?
