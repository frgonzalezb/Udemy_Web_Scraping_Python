You're the new volunteer? What? We're training now. Come here! But I... How's little John today? Hey, your rash is better. Darn! I wanted the new girl to put ointment on it! I'm back. Hi. Tanaka, what took you so long? Here's your hamburger. Wrong! I told you Mos Burger! Oh... You need to listen better! Sorry. What? Misaki? You know her? - Well... - Say... Did Tanaka recruit you? I'm glad a cutie is here. Ow ow ow! Don't push the bone. Me? Yes, you! Why are you here? Checking on you. I never get to see you. I told you I'm volunteering for med school. Glad you're not cheating on me. But put this before me? I'll be done tonight. Let's get dinner. Some place good! What, you're cancelling?! I need someone to spend the night. I can't turn over by myself. Whatever! - Takako. - Yes. Seto can't come tonight. What? That jerk. What will I do? We'll find someone else. How could he? I have MD! (Muscular Dystrophy) Oh. Tanaka, you heard that? Yes. You can stay tonight, right? Well... An aspiring doctor can't abandon a patient. - OK. - Oh no... Thank you! I'm relieved. What? Your name is Misaki? Why don't you stay too? Tanaka might screw up. Why'd you apply? But I... He likes you! You'll do great. Tonight will be fun! No no no no... You study education? Training to be a teacher? Give me wine. Come to my symposium? Show her the flyer. Here. "Independent living for people with disabilities" Instead of depending on family and facilities, I want to make a society that knows people with disabilities are all around. If the disabled say my lifestyle gives them hope, I can't deny it. - Misaki! - What? You like movies? Not really. Then music? Let's go to a jazz concert. But I think she's busy... I wasn't asking you. I'm talking to her. But it's after 2 a.m. I'm totally fine. I can't sleep anyway. I'm hungry. You should sleep... I want a banana. We have none. Buy one somewhere. I can't sleep without it. A banana! OK. I'll go look. Thanks. Take my wallet. Sorry. I'll go! You too? One of you stay. It's late. Don't leave me alone with that guy. Shikano, I'll get your banana. Crap! "Bananas 100 yen" "Closed" 51. You think she likes me? Well, but...maybe. Why just "maybe"? Hype me up. Sorry. 31. I found a banana. Wow! I just felt something amazing! A BANANA? AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT? So what's happening with that med student? C'mon, Misaki! You can't abandon our group dates. Have you done it with him? Um...well... His dad runs Tanaka Hospital, right? Yeah. Sure he's not just playing around? He's not like that. I'll be going to his house. No way! To meet his parents? For marriage?! But he's still a student. No fair! Set me up with one of his friends. I'll try. I'll get it. Miyataya Coffee. May I speak with Misaki Ando? Shut up! Are you Tanaka? Could you volunteer again? Why me? Shikano signed you up for a shift. Why? Couldn't you say no? You made him a little too happy... But I'll be there that day. We can go out afterward. Hold on. Why do all this for him? He doesn't want to end up at a hospital. They thought he'd be dead by 20. But he's been living at home, and now he's 34. Hmm... He's amazing. Sorry, I gotta go. Please. I'm counting on you. Hold on... Salmon. It tastes better when you feed me. It's the same. Yotsumoto can stay Tuesday night. Then I'll be going. See you. - Thanks! - Thanks! Rice. Shikano, can Takako make it on Sunday? Yes. Then Saturday night... - Is it here? - I know you're busy, but... We can't find someone - for the weekend. - See you! - Thanks. - Bye. Really? Oh good! Glad we filled that slot. Tanaka? The clock stopped. Is it the battery? Maybe. Water. We're out of batteries. I'll go get some. - Take his wallet. - Ok. - Bring the receipt. - Ok. Oh, and also... Ground coffee, 200 grams. A Dom Dom burger, vanilla ice cream. Town magazine, and... You know... Girlie magazine. Right? Right? Don't say it so loud! The volunteers always ask for it... Taka, my butt hurts. Oh. Here. He gets bedsores from sitting too long. Oh. That's good. OK. You're good at this, Misaki. Can you do it every day? Your beard doesn't grow every day. Yes, it does! Some people shave twice a day. Wait! Don't wipe me. I want her to. Sorry. Also, his cardiotonic and diuretic. Don't mix up his meds. You've gotten good at training. Oh, thanks. - Posture change! - Yes. That means, help him turn over. It's kinda hard. But once you get it, you can do it alone. Learn it, Misaki. - How's this? - Ok. What next... Maybe the kitchen. Ow ow ow! Ow ow ow! Sorry. You trying to kill me? Sorry. My shoulder! Just take it easy or you'll never be good at it. I got wine. Thanks. And your salami. Jonouchi, you know what I like! And I invited a friend to next month's symposium. That makes me happy. "I push people around" "because I want to show timid young people" "that asking others for favors is part of being alive." Your words moved me. You get it! By the way, about tonight... A family thing came up. What? Really... Oh... I'm screwed. Tsukada, can you stay tonight? I have work. Right... Tanaka? You can stay, can't you? He has a date tonight. A date? A date! You can do that anytime! How could a med student do this? Jonouchi, cigarette. Ok. You really should stop smoking. Shut up! I do what I want. Shikano, who do you think you are? What? You think being disabled makes you special? So you can say anything? Misaki, stop... These volunteers are spending their precious time to help you. What do you mean by "their time"? They learn from me. They say it's equal. Don't you realize how kind they are? Keep this up and they'll stop coming. No one quits. They all love me. They do. But I don't. Oh, so now you think you're special. You're awful. I'm never coming back. Good. Don't come back! Do I really have to watch this with you? It's embarrassing for me to have you wait in the other room. Isn't it more embarrassing to have me here? Fast forward it. Ok. Stop. It's no use. I can't concentrate. Get a pen and stationery. What? I'm writing a letter. A letter? - Do it! - Ok. "Dear Misaki Ando," "I'm terribly sorry about the other day." It's to Misaki? Yeah. Just write it. Me? My handwriting's getting worse. Just write. "Dear Misaki Ando," "I'm terribly sorry about the other day." - "I made you angry..." - Hold on. Just a moment. "I'm terribly..." "I'm terribly sorry about the other day." Write neatly! "...the other day." "I made you angry," "and I'm sorry." "I'm sorry." "However," "please understand me." ... "What can I say..." "I've fallen in love with you." You're writing that? That's the most important part. Skip a line there. "I want the chance to apologize." "I'd like to invite you to dinner." "Simply put, I'm asking you on a date." "Please consider it." Nice handwriting. - Hey, I wrote it. - What? Volunteers can't say no to anything. These are also from him. What is this volunteering, anyway? What? Why do you do so much for him? Just to feel good about yourself? He needs help. Can you go on a date with him? Aren't we a couple? Yeah. Of course. Is offering your girlfriend part of volunteering? ... It's not that! I mean... It'll really make him happy. Please! Just this once, OK? Please. Then do something for me. Of course. - No way. Here? - Yes. You mean now? Now! Now? Ok. Misaki! Misaki! Misaki! He looks really happy. Going out is his favorite thing. Thanks for coming! Isn't this great? Sure is! Don't grill it too much. Keep it rare. This is fun! My first date in a long time. You dated a lot before? I was a popular guy! But that caused trouble with my wife. Wife? You were married? That was the happiest time of my life. But then she cheated on you. That was my low point. But it's not like it killed me. I decided to chase my dreams. What are your dreams? I have lots. To eat Sapporo ramen. To travel to Biei. And to be on a talk show. But your biggest is to go to America. What? There's an activist named Eddie Young. He inspired me to live independently. Shikano wants to meet him, so he's learning English. It was hard to study in junior high. Took me forever to pass the Level 3 exam. Now he's going for Level 2. Anyway, I eventually wanna be famous. Famous? So you can change Japanese society? That too. But to get more volunteers. I can't live without volunteers. You just want to be adored and get women! No! It's for Japanese society! Oh, there's that noise again. Rock music... I love this song! Really? Maybe rock's OK sometimes. Misaki. How far will we go tonight? Will we stay here forever? I'm gonna explode Being alive is too wonderful I want you to kiss me So we can get closer to our dreams I want you to kiss me Look, he's having a blast. I'm glad he's having fun. What's wrong? What is it? Sorry... What? I ate too much rare meat. What? - I can't hold it. - Ok. Oh no. Oh no, oh no. This is awful. Just a little more! - Almost there. - Can you go faster? Sorry. The wheelchair restroom is over there! Sorry. Oh no! Here it comes! I'm gonna lose it! You just have to squeeze your muscles. But my disease weakens my muscles! Oh, right. I'm sorry. What happened? It's fine. We brought clothes. I'm totally fine. I'm not depressed at all. I'm fine. I don't care. Ha! This is hilarious. That really got to him. It's painful to hear him say this! It's OK. Everyone poops their pants sometimes. What? You too? I took my university exam in soiled pants. No way! It's true. You rock! Let's all go to karaoke sometime! - Sounds fun! - Doesn't it? We should go, Shikano. Are you sure? But women lose their minds when they hear me sing! Really? You rock. Your pulse is irregular. It's your cardiomyopathy dilation. Your heart is getting weaker. We're admitting you. You know more than anyone how much I hate hospitals! You're impossible. You encouraged me to live independently. I've lost patience. That was a mistake. I can't guarantee you'll live. What do doctors know about life? I was told I wouldn't live to be 20. But I'm still here today. I'll be responsible for my life. Takako, turn the tape over. Just a moment. Misaki! You're here. You're working hard. I want to go to America. I think I'll find a new me there. What's your dream? Mine? For now, just to make a good meal. Then I'll have curry. Medium spicy. And we're almost out of toilet paper and detergent. Oh, and dumplings. Is that an order? I can't go myself so I have to ask someone. You don't hold back, do you? But this is my house! Who holds back in their own home? It's totally different from a hospital. Got it. Good afternoon. Hello! - Hi, Mrs. Shikano! - Hi. Thanks for always taking care of my stupid son. Nice to see you! I've made inari sushi and croquettes. Take them away! You're bothering us. They're not for you. They're for the volunteers. Just leave, you old hag! I know I'm old, but must you call me a hag? So rude! Stop thinking people will do anything for you! The guest may leave now! Fine! Stupid son. Don't come back! You're really leaving? Your son's no angel. He's quite abusive. Is it because he's shy? What can I do? It's all my fault. No, it's not! I gave him that body. Parents of disabled children always work too hard. I did everything for him. But since he decided to live on his own, I couldn't help him even if I wanted to. He's really a kind boy at heart. He used to love it when I made inari sushi. The elevators in train stations were built after years of efforts by the disabled. Today, the elderly and parents using strollers can't do without them. Our idea is that by making society more convenient for the disabled, society will be more convenient for everyone. Are there any other questions? Yes. Go ahead, young man. Do you have any dreams? I do. I want to pass the English exam and go to America. I want to see Eddie who inspired me, and tour independent living centers. Could you do that? Well, I was told I'd never survive without family or hospitals, but now I'm living independently. If your will is strong, you can do anything. And eventually I want to appear on a talk show. Why did you decide to live independently? I made an amazing friend named Kuwajima. He goes to theaters and discos in a wheelchair. I was jealous about how many girls he got. So I wanted to go out, too. You just wanted girls? Yes. But wasn't it hard to find volunteers and teach them care? Well, I can't do anything unless I ask someone for help. It takes courage to ask other people to help you. Thank you! You made all this? I can't guarantee it's good. I'm so happy! Shall we? Thanks. Let's dig in. - OK, the blue one. - Ok. Let's eat. Wow! - It's no good? - No! It's too good! Yes! Hey, are you free Sunday? Why? We talked about meeting my parents. Oh. Sure, if it's OK. - I'll come over. - Good! My mom's really set on Sunday. She'll ask about future plans, too. What? Like what kind of school you want to teach at. If you can keep teaching after we marry. How many kids we want. That stuff. Um... - Actually... - It's OK! We haven't talked about marriage. No, not that. Um... I lied. What? I'm not studying education. Yes? Sorry. But it's true that I wanted to be a teacher. I had this really nice teacher... You lied to go to mixers with med students? It's not that I wasn't interested... But I'm with you because I love you. And remember at the restaurant, that one waiter was terrible? But you helped him. What will my parents say? They'll think I lied to them! Then I'll apologize. Is that OK? Look. I understand it was hard to admit it. I want to be generous and forgive you. But why did you wait until now to tell me? What if I hadn't said anything? I can't help but get angry. You're mad? You forgive me? Which is it? You're the one who lied. Fine. Then Sunday's cancelled. What? You have a boyfriend? What's he like? - Actually... - No, stop. If you tell me then I can't ask you out. But I think it's over. I shouldn't have lied to him. - You lied? - Yes. About being in school. What? In high school I thought about becoming a teacher. But I failed, and now I work part-time. Pathetic, huh? I see. But you wanted him to like you, right? My mouth is my only weapon, so I lie all the time! So why don't you turn it into the truth? What? Go to school and become a teacher. That's easier than taking the English exam at my age! We've switched positions. You're encouraging me. Our positions are equal. We're both human. I'm happy to help you. And this is my chance. Yes? If he dumps you, then I'm next! Shikano, what have you lied about? I've exaggerated about pain, pretended to be sad. I put on an act to keep my volunteers! And you really want your mom's help, right? I wanted my mom. She was busy with work. If I relied on my mother, she'd spend all her time on me. I want my parents to live their lives. And it's hard to hear them say my disease is their fault and to keep apologizing. Anyway, people think caring for the disabled is the family's job. I'm pushing back against that idea. Sorry I'm late. You're really late! Being on time is your only good point. My time's up. See you. Bye! What did you wish for? It's a secret. Of course I'm not telling! Come on! - And you? - Yes? To get into university. What? I'll take the test next year. I've started studying. Wow! Great. We should study together. You going out? On a date with Misaki? No. Oh, hello dear. Hi. Where are you going? Volunteering again? I won't tell you not to, but you really need to study so you can take over the hospital. I know. I'll see you later. Wow! Thanks so much. Learn all this and you'll get into the best university. Oh, Tanaka's staying! We can play Othello until morning. Let him sleep! After you insert the tracheal tube... What? Tanaka! I'm sorry. Give me the bag valve. How can you quit with a phone call? You said you'd always help! I want to help people who need it. But you're enjoying your life. You're carefree and happy. What are you saying? I shouldn't enjoy my life? Don't act like you know me! Hey... Hello? Hello?! He hung up. That jerk! You knocked that one! Doing that makes him feel better. Shikano, half of our student volunteers will graduate in March. They should all repeat a year! We'll look for new volunteers. Let's pass out flyers at the university. Right, Tsukada. Hey, what about my birthday? We're looking for volunteers! An MD patient needs help. Please help. You'll get good meals! Here you are. Thank you! It's gotten chilly. This warms me to my heart. "Volunteers needed" Hey, didn't you recruit by yourself at first? Yeah. I could move a lot more then. You're amazing. You just realized? I'm always working like crazy. The ramen here is good. - I wanna try! - Let's go! Tanaka! What a surprise! Well, this is my school... Misaki just asked me out on a lunch date. Want to join us? No, I'll pass. Why not? It's spicy! What?! You went from a med student to a guy in a wheelchair? It's not like that. But things with Tanaka came to an end. But you can't break up! I wanna meet his friends! I want a kind, rich, educated, perfect boyfriend. But it wasn't working out. What? I can be myself around Shikano. Are you sure it's not sympathy? Can he go out for meals or trips in a wheelchair? And how can you do it with him? If he has a muscle disease, can he get it up? It's not about that. Can I use your dictionary? Sure. Change the tape. You found that? The volunteers leave those things... What? What do you do when you watch this? What? You gonna make me say? So that's not affected by MD? That's a bold question, Misaki! The little guy works with tissue, so my disease doesn't affect him. Really. Mitani is running late. Could you stay until he gets here? - Sure. - Thanks. Thanks! See you tomorrow. - Have a good time at work! - Thanks. See you. Bye. Sorry for the strange question. Misaki. Hey. Why did you ask? Why? I'll change the tape. If I were a normal guy, I'd be holding you now, right? It's pouring! I'm soaked. I'll go now. Misaki... probably isn't coming back. What happened? If no one had come, she would have gotten in bed with me. - See you. - Bye. Misaki said she can't come. Oh. Oh well. Go pick up your kid. But I can't leave you alone. I'm fine. It'll just be a moment. Your darling daughter is waiting. Go ahead. Alright. I'll hurry. Thanks! - Hey! - We're back... Shikano! - Are you OK? - I fell. Shikano! Shikano! Shikano! Shikano! Shikano! Misaki! I'm sorry. It's my fault. Misaki... Yes? I'm... not gonna make it. I have... one last request. Yes. Anything. Your boobs. Let me touch them. What? This is the first time something good happened in a hospital! Misaki came back! Come on! I was really worried! Don't joke around like that! No point in worrying. Three years ago we thought it was over. Heart failure caused fluid retention. If he didn't pee by morning, he was done. We even talked about his funeral. Then suddenly he peed like crazy! He's an immortal legend! - Tsukada, get my glasses. - Ok. OK Hey, after I get out, let's go to karaoke. I'm not going! Let's go! You're awful! She's angry. Doctor. Doctor, I'm fine. I want to go home. I'm sorry, but you can't. Why? Your CO2 levels are too high. Your lung muscles are weak. Isn't breathing hard now? We'll need to put you on a ventilator. A ventilator? He needs a tracheotomy? What will happen then? It'll take the load off his heart and make breathing easier. You'll be connected to a big machine, so your movement will be limited. Like a dog on a leash? Won't that close his vocal cords? So he can't talk? He'll have to accept that. No! No ventilator! Can't we choose the treatment the patient wants? NPPV We can do NPPV, right? That way he just puts on a mask to help him breathe. We can't admit him. Why? His primary doctor knows best. If we treat differently, it's not fair to Dr. Nohara. Then I'll explain it to her carefully. Hisashi, listen to me. Doctors must take all factors into consideration. Is it proper to do everything the patient wants? But what he wants is his life! His voice is the only weapon he has to live. Please don't take his freedom. Thanks, Tanaka. It's a long road ahead. Was everything OK? With your dad? You were worried things weren't going well. But this was the first time he accepted my opinion. Really. Thanks to me! Yeah. I'm putting the mask on. It's ready. - Let's start. - Yes. Take it off. - Take it off. - Yes. Doctor. It hurts. It'll take time to get used to the airflow from the machine. Everyone's different. Let's keep trying. Shikano. Here we go. Which one do you want? This one? OK! I'll ask the doctor. Thank you. "English test" I'm sorry. They said you can't leave this weekend. What do you mean? Just one day! You mean I can't take the test? Every day is vital for me. Next time who knows how I'll be? Look. I can't knock the cup over. Soon I won't be able to hold a pencil. If you're telling me to give up on taking the test and going to America... - Takamura? - I never said that! - Tanaka. - Why did you let him leave? He wanted to take it! Why didn't you tell me?! What's wrong? His condition worsened. Back to the hospital! We contacted Nishiku Hospital. Why Dr. Nohara and not my father?! He says he can't go back there. Tanaka... I'm here. What is it? I... love... you. What are you gonna do? No! I can't lose my voice. You're gonna die! Help! Help me! "Surgery in progress" After all this, I couldn't help him. What happens next is what matters. I'm so sorry. - Mrs. Shikano! - Mr. Shikano. I'm his father. Thank you all for taking care of him. Hello. Have a seat. Please have a seat. Sorry. Yasuaki will be fine. This isn't enough to make him give in. Look. He was a great runner as a kid. But from age 6, he started tripping and falling. - Stand up! - Stupid! Klutz! Be a man and give it back to them! Yasuaki, let's die together. Shut up! The doctor said I'd get better! I'm not dying! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Well, at least he survived this. I'll be going now. You're leaving? If I stay we'll just fight. But you should stay, at least for today. Hey! Yasuaki, how do you feel? You OK? I get it. You want us to leave. Mother...mother... Mother? Mother! Mother! Yasuaki? What is it? When using a ventilator, phlegm builds up in the trachea and lungs. If we don't suck it out, he'll suffocate. I'm putting it in now. Air will come through the cuff. We put air through the cuff to keep saliva out of the trachea. 24 hours for suctioning. I'm leaving now. - Thank you. - Thank you. OK "I want to go to karaoke" OK Karaoke? Feel better now? Oh my! This must be hard. No, it's not so bad. What is it? ... It's upside down! Tsukada! Miso? This is soy sauce ramen. I wanted miso ramen. They were out of miso. Too bad. Can't you let me sleep?! I haven't slept at all! Water. I'm sorry. Shikano! Look! There's a patient with a ventilator who adjusted the airflow in the cuff and was able to talk! What's this? Where'd you get this? The girls at the cafe set up a mixer with doctors. I see! - You adjust the airflow. - That's it. But this person just happened to make it work. Will it work for everyone? What if something happens? I...want...to...try. You want to try? Then we won't tell the nurses. No way! We can't do that. We'll take it from the first marker. Here we go. Does it hurt? Stop! The nurse is coming. I'll restore the airflow. Hello. Sorry. Sorry. Is something wrong? Now we'll try it from the second marker. What's that? We heard that removing air will let him talk. Here we go. Shikano, are you OK? Don't take any risks. What are you thinking? Shikano is amazing. Yeah. I think he's getting stronger. Stronger than I am. I couldn't live like that. Me neither. Say... I may quit med school. Why? Someone as unsure as I am shouldn't be a doctor. Why? What? Why? I just don't have the confidence. This isn't for me. But... I've been thinking I wish I had a doctor as kind as you. But really... I'm not kind. - Just pretending. - You are kind! No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. - But... All I think is bad things. I'm a hypocrite. Hey, Shikano told me. About what? What? You almost slept with him? What? He told me. What does that mean? Oh...It wasn't that... You'll do anything out of pity? Is that it? What? What? But maybe it's not pity. I may really love him. You don't get it. Sorry. Whatever! Good morning. Good morning? Morning. Good morning. Morning. No way! I did it. You can talk! Yay! You did it! That hurts! Sorry! It's a good hurt. I'm happy too. So happy. My boobs. You wanted to touch them, right? You're amazing! This is wonderful! Great! He gets his way. But at least nothing bad happened. Doctor. I want to go home. No! If phlegm builds up, you'll die. I have volunteers. That's right. We can do it. Suctioning is a procedure only doctors and nurses can do. Family is the only exception. Doctor... My volunteers are my family. Even if I died in their care, I'd have no complaints. No matter what you say, you can't leave. If I'm stuck in this hospital, I'm not myself! I won't die counting holes in the ceiling! You go home after work. So I want to go home too. It's not that simple. Suctioning requires training. Yes, we can. Don't talk down to us. We need volunteers! Looking for home help volunteers! We need as many as we can get. Could you help? Just give us a little time. Today's guest is Mr. Tsukada, an independent living support volunteer. The rockin' MD patient Shikano needs your help! Thank you. Please sit anywhere. Volunteer trainees, enter this way. Please come in. Misaki! - We're here! - Thank you! Where should we sit? - In front. - Really? - Let's go! - No. Slowly insert... the tube. The most important thing is to have a strong awareness that you're responsible for his life. That concludes the explanation. Now let's try suctioning. Thanks, Shikano. It's scary! - Oh no! - It's OK. You're fine. Here we go. Oh! I'm so sorry! - Go! - Do it slowly. Here I go. - It's OK. - Now. Slowly. Turn it. Turn and go slowly. Like that. Come anytime if something happens. I won't come back. I've finally broken free. You have quite a family. Thank you. I was able to live independently again, thanks to my "Shikano family". I see. Thank you. Make me look good in the article. Take a good picture. Here we go. One more. Smile. Hello? Tanaka? Where have you been? I was worried about you. Tanaka? Thank you. We'll let you know the publication date. Come again. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Thank you. Make the photo big! Shikano. Tanaka is quitting. What? Tanaka. Long time no see. Wait. I'm having a recovery party. I can't go. I quit volunteering. Misaki told me. You're quitting med school too? Remember when you started volunteering? You proudly told me, "I'm here because" "I want to be a doctor who can face patients." "I want to be a doctor" "who can care for every patient." I knew nothing then. I thought I could do more. But I was wrong. Life is also hard for healthy people. What do you want to do? What's important to you? I don't know... You can talk to me about anything. After all, we're friends. Are we? I think so. Say anything. I have nothing to say. Speak your mind. Are you being honest with yourself? Is being honest such a good thing? You're proud of your honesty. But what does it mean? You try being pushed around. Thanks for everything. "Yasuaki Shikano Recovery Party!" Thanks to the ventilator, I'm breathing splendidly. The ventilator has become a part of my body. Ventilators rock! That's how I feel. You should try one sometime! Now my goal is to tell the world that you can still have a bright future even with a ventilator. He hated it at first. He's unpredictable. when I started living independently, every day with my volunteers was a battle. We butted heads. We fought many times. We hurt each other. But because we were so honest with each other, I came to understand you and you have come to understand me. The fact that I'm alive today is because, through wind, rain and snow, every day. every second, you were by my side. I'm so glad I met all of you. Truly. Truly. Thank you. Wonderful, Shikano! And so that from here on, Shikano will continue to be healthy and incredibly selfish towards us all! Let's toast! Shikano, we thank you. Cheers! What's this? Misaki. Yes? Here. It's a cheap ring, but my heart is in it. Will you accept? What? In front of everyone? It's because every day I'm living in everyone's view. It's impossible to propose alone. My wish at New Year's was you. I love you. I want to be with you forever. I'm sorry. Shikano, you're... important to me and a big part of my life. But I can't accept this. I... um... I like someone. He's been through a lot. He gave up on his dreams. There's nothing between us now. But... I'm still attracted to him. And... I'm frustrated. So... I'm sorry. But thank you. Have you changed your mind about quitting school? That's a shame. Help me up, please. Sure. I'll take this off. 3, 2, 1. Here. Ok. Thank you for your help. "Getting help to do what he can't" "Don't give up on dreams" What do you want to do? What's important to you? Stretch out the wrinkles. They hurt his skin. Thanks for teaching me. Something's strange lately. He naps a lot. He's more mellow. It's like he's achieved enlightenment. Say... Dr. Nohara said, "While he can," "let him do everything he wants." Those were her words. I love to travel! Isn't this great! We're not here for fun, OK? That sheep looks delicious. It does. This feels great. Wonderful. Isn't this beautiful? Yeah! Wow. This is lavender ice cream. And this is milk. This is the ultimate mix! There's craft beer, too. I want some! He was so happy as soon as we planned this trip. His tests were good too. Yeah. It's all in the mind. I wish Misaki could have come. Enjoy. Misaki? Yes. - Phone call. - Ok. Misaki! Thank you. I'm glad you could both come. What is this?! I thought you were dying! Stop screwing around! This isn't a joke! Tanaka, are you crying? No, I'm not! I'm just angry. Please! I'm so sorry! Really. He fooled us all too! He's awful. I fell over with the intention of dying. That was some great acting! I really thought you were gone. He really wanted you two to get back together. Forgive him! Misaki! Don't touch me! Sorry! I'm so happy you both are here. You're gonna volunteer again, right? - What? - What? Anyway, let's drink! - Right. - Let's! Let's drink! OK, let's do it! Tanaka, will you make a toast? You make the best toasts. OK. To the revived Shikano. Cheers! Why didn't you tell me? "Misaki is my girlfriend." Don't carry that tough-guy act too far! There are more things people can't do than things they can. I hate it when you do that. I hate it! Don't say it twice. Sorry. I'd hate myself if I had to meet me. Misaki hates me too. You don't get it. What? Wake up and realize her feelings for you! What? Looks like fun. What are you talking about? - It's secrets between men. - Yes! That's not fair. By the way... That newspaper article got us new volunteers. Lots of cute university students. Don't be jealous. I may be. Shikano... I too will try being true to myself. I'm going back to med school. Really? I don't want to disappoint myself. And I can't fail you. OK. I'll let you examine me. Give me a break! You never listen to doctors. Are you running away from your patient? You run away from hospitals! You're right. Misaki, do your best on the exam. OK. You'll be a wonderful teacher. Thanks. And, Tanaka, you're the one who brought Misaki to me. Thanks to you, I had fun. Really. A lot happened in this year. Thank you. Thank you. - Amazing. - Beautiful. Look at me! I'm getting better! I bet I could run! "Seven years later" "To mother" "Dear mother," "I want you to" "live your life." "Don't work too hard." "You loved me so much it hurt." "I'm sorry I turned you away." "But that was how I wanted to live." "Love, Your stupid son." I'm so sorry. My old man hates hospitals. It's OK. Some patients prefer to be at home. Do you have more patients after this? I have to work hard or I'll be scolded. By whom? Above the clouds, someone annoying is watching. Teacher's here! How are you? We're great! What will we sing today? Today a song from my past. What is it? "Ms. Misaki Congratulations on your marriage" "How far will we go tonight?" "Will we stay here forever?" "I'm gonna explode" "Being alive is too wonderful" "I want you to kiss me" "So we can get closer to our dreams" "I want you to kiss me" 200242 "In 2002, Yasuaki Shikano died at age 42."
