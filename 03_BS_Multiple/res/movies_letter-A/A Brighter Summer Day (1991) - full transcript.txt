foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Fine. I understand. We doctors should show a charitable spirit. I told my father about the medical expenses. He understands your financial situation. There's no need to worry. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. It appears her problem is only partly physical. Let her rest here a few days. I'll take good care of her. They all say Honey was killed by the 217s, but the newspapers say it was a traffic accident. Some people say he's AWOL from the military. Didn't he go back south? Stop nagging! It's none of your business! Tell me. I made a bet that the news was wrong. How could he go AWOL? Didn't you see it happen, Ma? None of your fucking business! Quit shooting off your mouth! I'll beat the shit out of you. Let's go. Time for class. Already? I've gotta go to the bathroom. Why don't you go between classes? I've been looking for you for days. You didn't come to class. Were you sick? I thought he went back south. Before leaving Taipei... he left me the address of his hideout. I was planning to go see him. He even laughed at me... for being so worried. It was strange. For many days while I lay sick in bed, I couldn't recall Honey's face. I was scared and confused. Ming, don't be afraid! You have to be brave! I'm with you. You needn't be afraid! I'll always be with you! I'll be your friend forever! I'll protect you. I don't need anyone's help. No one can help anyway. Hey, it's Ming! By herself. - You got ideas? - Shit! I wouldn't dare. Hey, look. Still blame me for your leg injury? - Wasn't Tiger going out with her? - She's not talking to him. Here he comes. Weren't you going out with her? Honey's dead. Now she's anyone's game... but I don't think you stand much of a chance. Honey's no problem, dead or alive. The idiot acted like an arrogant prick at the concert. He wasn't hit by no car. The 217 boys let him have it. You got something to say? Goddamn it! Hurry up or I'll miss the last bus. Take it easy. I'll give you a ride. Think I'll fall for that again? Try throwing it at me again, boy. Look at this guy. Is he for real? I guess so. Think it over. Don't feel pressured. I've got to go. it's late. Getting Si'r transferred to day school is complicated. I thought I could talk my way through it so he wouldn't have to take the transfer exams. I'll try my friends on the Board of Education again. Thanks a lot. I'm still working on your teaching certificate. It'll take some time. Good-bye. How could he ask me for a favor like that? Try to just play along- Don't be too hardheaded. Don't let it get to you. Try not to make enemies. This isn't Shanghai, where you had Professor Hsia to back you up. Being stubborn won't make you any friends. This time it's the new office furniture. Next time it'll be the new building contract. There'll be no end to it. Haven't you figured him out yet? You're the last person on his list. God knows how many others are involved. What do you women know? He must have his own problems. I'll try to talk to him. Are you crazy? MING CAME TO SCHOOL TODAY, BUT... Why'd you have to take him on? Let's go find him. We'll try the basketball court. Shit! What's that? - Follow me if you have the balls. - It's suicide, man! Suicide? I'll show them! Take that! And that! It's useless. This knife is for girls. They'll laugh at you. Where'd you get it? In the attic, with all the rest of it. Cool it. Stick to your tapes. I've got an idea. Let's get Ma's help. Sh, you guys are dose. Why ask other people for favors? We gotta get revenge, damn it! At least borrow his samurai sword. What's up? That's what I want to know. Cat said you wanted me. No, I didn't. Why the long face? Is it a girl? No. I told you it wasn't that. Getting worked up over some chick looks bad. Understand? Look what happened to Honey. Everyone on the street was scared of him. Then, all because of some chick, he ends up - Is it Tiger? No. That's good. Load it. Now hold on tight and aim up. Go on. Feels great, huh? Unload and put in a new one. Go over there, man. Shit, I'm showing you a good time! Well? Did you get a kiss out of her? All this and not even a kiss? She wouldn't let you? Go on. Take Jade around back. Hurry UP- She won't mind. Shit! What is this? I'm bending over backwards for you, and you - Forget it. Dumplings and buns! Si'r, where are you going? Won't even answer! Little punk! Watch where you're going! I love the night... She's always nagging! I can't stand her nagging! Tough shit! You again? Working extra hours? Making some money? Every penny counts. Why make so much? Saving it for a wife? Not one like yours. You can't even drink at home. What are you doing? Don't act like a hooligan! Don't come near me! Sergeant Chad.! - What is it? - Come quick! Another heart attack. Take it easy. You sure are heavy. I was afraid you'd have trouble finding this place. Xiao Si'r. Let's kill Mao Zedong! Skin Zhou Enlai! Let's take back the mainland! Horsecart! How many vehicles you got? - Plenty. You gotta be careful. You trust the drivers? - They're all our people. Good. Who's that kid? - He's with me. Why'd you turn it off? I didn't. It took forever to tune. Now I have to start all over. Why'd you use my comic books? I looked all over for them. You know how long it takes to tune this? Go get it fixed, will you? LITTLE PARK ICE CREAM PARLOR What are you doing? - Damn you, Blind Man! - Goddamn it! Go to hell! Selfish bastard! You took advantage of me! Take your records with you! I don't want them! You'll be sorry when I'm dead! You no-good, shameless bastard! Any woman who touches you is cursed! Cheat! Asshole! You're not a man! You picked a great time to join the gang - the night of a typhoon! Even Baldy hasn't shown up. Ka Wu's gone to get him. Why so jittery? Where you going? To take a shit. Don't out out on us. The typhoon's coming. Why haven't you closed up? Useless old motherfucker. Go home and jerk off! Fuck you! Relax. The power's out. How come no one's around? You two go watch the back door. What do we do about this guy? Can we go back now? Put that cleaver down! You all right? Go after them! The initiation's starting and you're home asleep! - It was mahjong. - Mahjong my ass! You still owe me from last time, remember? Let's play another game afterwards. Ka Wu! Ka Wu! Do you know how lonely life can be? You know what it feels like in the depths of despair? Then go kill yourself! You're a fuckin' drag. No one respects me. What's the use of living? I'm better off dead. Please let me borrow that. Help me - Run! Crazy... Did you kill Honey? Shandong! Crazy... Shandong! Please get UP! Come on, get up. Shandong! I could swear he sings “...a brighter summer day.” But is that grammatically correct? Mr. Zhang. What is it? Could we do this tomorrow during office hours? It's a rather unusual matter... All right. Let me get a jacket. Is it something Si'r did? Residents in southwest Taiwan should be prepared for floods. People on ships in the vicinity of Taiwan should also be on the alert... You go to bed. I'll wait up for Morn. Mom went to Mr. Wang's house. She's been gone two hours. People came and took Dad away. I think they were with the Secret Police. You're soaking wet! - I forgot my raincoat. You seem to lack inner calm. Don't give me your religion. I've lived an honest life. I have nothing to hide. We have no doubt of that. May I go, then? I have to go to work. You'd better rest a bit first. Is this about Professor Hsia again? We only touched on one element last night. Here. Relax. Write what you feel. Don't hold back. I studied music. I'm an artistic type. You're really my superior in that regard. I really do understand how educated people feel. Well, I'll leave you alone for a while. Oh, one other thing. There's no actual sign, but smoking's not allowed. Sorry. it's the rules. But before - The blood and tears I shed for you know no end As I cast aside the red bean symbol of my longing The spring willows bloom eternally And spring flowers fill my painted chambers My sleep's disturbed by the wind and rain Pattering on the screen window after dusk I'm unable to forget my new woes Or my old sorrows I can't swallow my delicate foods And I choke on the golden brasenia soup I can't believe How frail I look in my flowered mirror I can't unfurrow my knitted brow Nor bear to feel another tear fall Do you know Li Nan-tien? Uh... yes. College classmate. So why didn't you write it down? He didn't come to Taiwan. We've lost contact. Didn't come to Taiwan? You know Liang Jin-chen? Liang Jin-chen? I don't think I've heard the name before. Think carefully. Are you sure? I don't think so. Think carefully. In July 1939 you began work in an accounting department. Who trained you to take over his job? Oh... Mr. Liang. A sort, chubby guy with gold-rimmed glasses. So you do remember. Why didn't you write it down? I wasn't lying. We work so hard to learn the truth. Leaving out something you know is the same as lying. You know Chao Nien-lu? - No. Hsun Feng-shih? Kuo Li-an? Yes. Shh Chun-chuan'? Shih Chun-chuan? Yes. How do you know him? He was a friend of a coworker. When we first came to Taiwan, I bought an old bike from him real cheap so the kids could get to school. I only met him once. A reporter or something. His name was kind of odd. That's why I remember it. Is that all? Yes. Why didn't you write it down? Who was the coworker? Mr. Tseng. Tseng Hung-yuan. - How do you write that? “Hung” as in “swan.” You and your wife married secretly in Shanghai in 1940. We had witnesses and a dinner- Without a marriage certificate, it's a secret marriage. We registered at city hall, and we - Did Professor Hsia introduce you to your wife? No, we met at a dance. In June of 1942, your wife was teaching elementary school. Why did she resign? My eldest daughter was born. My salary was enough at the time. I preferred to have her care for the baby. Is that the only reason? This says she left for her uncle's in Shanghai at age 11. Shouldn't it say her father's brother-in-law? Well, I - You seem to lack inspiration. There's much you still don't recall. Don't worry. We have all the time in the world. You grow so fast. Hold your breath. Remind me to let it out for you tonight. What happened with your old man? What do you mean? That night after the fight, did he notice anything when you got home? No, he'd gone to a movie with my mom. Wow, your sister's really cool! Thanks. Move. I found that picture with the knife. She must have used it in a love suicide. Quit staring at it. Take it if you want. Hey, I talked to Horsecart! - What for? I told him I'm your buddy. He'll help us. Stand up straight. Don't make me repeat myself. You got that? There's no one here. I knew you'd be here. What you told me last time... did you really mean it? I hope you weren't lying. I couldn't bear that. It's Saturday again. Want to cut class? No, we have all the time in the world. Spring disappears Without a trace Leaving nothing behind... Here for your shot? Go over there. Apologize to them. Go on! Want me to make you? Motherfucker! Is that good enough? Forget it. Let's go. Not a chance! Just watch your step from now on. What are you so pleased about? Fix me up with Airplane! Cat is cuter. I want to meet Airplane! I want one too! You need to be more aggressive on defense. Don't let him get by. Next two. Keep your arms out on defense. Go on. What's your connection to Wang Kuo-cheng? Wang? He's... a classmate. “Wang”? You seem to know him well. Well... not really. I see him now and then at class reunions. Here. Write more? I'll be back for it before dawn. I'm almost done. Give me a little more time. That's enough. You can go now. Hurry UP- - Hurry up. - My button fell off again. - Didn't your sister just fix it for you? - Yes. Mrs. Zhang. Do you have safety pins? You better go or you'll be late. Is my shirt ironed? I have to go to work. It's better this way. They found someone at the office to take over my work. Less work means less trouble. You think it's related to your interrogation? Don't say things with no proof. How stupid can you be? Weren't they waiting for a confession about Wang before they'd release you? I thought he was trying to help us. The way I see it... he was trying to dissociate himself from you. You're too honest to cover up his corruption. What kind of crazy idea is that? Didn't you go to him while I was being held? Didn't he do his best to help? Maybe he was pretending. Maybe he was behind the whole thing. And that promotion he got you - You women! You know nothing about friendship between men! What are you good for besides being suspicious? It's been tough enough for us already. You and the kids are all I have left. Please don't frighten me anymore. We only have each other now. If you're not afraid, then I won't be. What's the matter, Tiger? Come on, speak up. You should at least talk to him. You worried he'll try to get back at you? He won't. It's over. Let's drop him, okay? How come you never told me about him? What's there to tell? Lots of guys have ideas about me. Haven't you heard enough? Take the young doctor, for example. Couldn't you tell? How do you feel when I tell you these things? Can't you just ignore them? You can't ask others to do what you think is right. People will look down on you. You mean you'll look down on me. Who's there? Lao Er, Si'r, get up! There's a thief! Lao Er, get up, hurry! Lao Er! See if the front door's been opened. Hurry! The front door's fine. You sure? Yes. Take this! He's hiding. He's hiding outside. Impossible! Check the roof! - Get the flashlight. - Where is it? Hurry! - Where is it? - In the kitchen drawer. Hurry! I can't find it. Why don't you turn on some lights? What's with all the noise? I'm trying to sleep! He's hiding under the bed. He was standing right here and then suddenly vanished! It can't be! I saw him right here! How could he just vanish? He couldn't have gotten away! Let her rest for now. Everything's under control. Luckily you rushed her over in time. Didn't I warn her about charcoal smoke? Since ancient times the Chinese have loved camellias for their elegance and refined beauty. The kids used to play around here and pick the flowers when they were little. This reminds me of your grandfather. The blossoms bring back happy memories of him. Who's that lady? You mean Hsiang-li? We're getting married in September. I don't like her. She's strange. There's no love between you. She's not for you. You kids don't understand such things. You don't have to say anything if you don't want to. Why do you think I don't understand? Love isn't fun and games. Lots of guys say they love me, but... the minute there's trouble, they all run away. If you're troubled about something, you must tell me before I can help you. I won't tell you. You wouldn't tell me, right? Don't worry about your mother's medical expenses. We're too close to worry about such things. Still don't want to tell me? Zhang Zhen. Come here a minute. This is for your own good. I don't mean to pry, but for a love affair at your age, you need good advice. Behaving like a hooligan, huh? Stand up straight when the doctor's talking! Motherfucking bitch. What are you? The secret police? What did you just say? Say that again. What did you say? I said you're the secret police. Before that. About my mother. Try saying it again! - Fucking bitch! What's going on? What's this here? Your students act like a bunch of hooligans. Foul-mouthed and violent! Dating girls and messing around with relationships! - Mind your own fucking business! - Zhang Zhen! To the conduct office! Big deal! Who cares? You had some harsh words about us last time. What about your parental guidance? Such foul language! Even I was embarrassed. You parents don't do your job and then blame it on us. You have some nerve! Please give him another chance. Too late! He's fallen this far already. If we don't punish him properly, you'll blame us again for not doing our job. I don't want to be responsible for that. It was my negligence. Kids sometimes lose their heads. Please excuse him just this once. If he gets another demerit for this, he can't move on to the next grade. That would be... too unfair to him. Unfair? Didn't you think we were unfair last time? Didn't you say you didn't care about demerits? How come you care now? We all work for the same government. What makes you so high and mighty? Mr. Zhang, buy some buns! What's wrong? In a bad mood? Don't worry! The sun will rise again tomorrow. A lively soul is never stifled by a fart, right? Dumplings and buns! Don't worry, Dad. Getting expelled isn't that bad. This way I can take the transfer exam this summer. I'll get into day school for you. Don't worry about me, Dad. I remember everything you said. I'll always listen to you. I remember you said one's own future can be determined by one's own efforts. I hit him with the bat because he went too far, just like last time when you - If I quit smoking, the money I save every month... will be enough to buy you glasses on the installment plan. So when will we see each other again? Not until I've taken the transfer exams. You can always come to school to see me. Next time I enter the school gate, I'll be a day school student. Sounds like Honey when he said he was going back to Tainan. You're not happy. I'll be worried about you. Don't be silly. Study hard. I'm behind you all the way. But let's not go today, okay? Everything's all arranged. Plus Cat and Airplane are both invited. Oh, dear! Our servant has quit. Sorry I didn't come out earlier to say hello. Don't worry. We'll help ourselves. Is this your classmate? She's so pretty. When I was carrying him, I wanted a girl. Look how big he is now. There you go again! Take your feet off the table. Where are the others? - Range? - 700 yards. - How many? - A platoon. Too far. It won't reach. Use mine. Shit! They've got tanks! It's okay. We've got grenades. Who goes there? Password! Commie woman. Hands up. - What are you doing? - Girls aren't into this stuff. Stay back! Cheer up, will you? Doesn't my thoughtfulness mean anything? Getting expelled from school is no big deal. You don't even look after your own girlfriend. Your father's government career is doomed because of it and because of his relations with Professor Hsia. I'm proud of all you kids for pulling through. Especially Si'r. He's so determined to get back on track after all that's happened. Mom, after graduation, I'll work a while before going abroad. No, you go as soon as you get your scholarship. But Lao Er's going to college, plus there's Si'r and the youngest one. It's too much for you. We've managed up to now. Don't worry until you've made it in America. Four pounds of rice. Can you put this on credit, Uncle Fat? No problem. May I butt in? Many people say I'm too nosy, but I'm actually a lot like your husband. You have preserved eggs? Over there. Your SH saved my “fie. I think it's my turn to help you. Uncle Fat said Mr. Lin is native Taiwanese. A very honest man. He's starting a fruit export business. He needs a partner with formal education. The starting salary may not be much, but if you work hard, you'll be your own man. What if he goes bankrupt a month from now? Talk to him first. Feel each other out. You can't doubt a guy without knowing him. I've worked for the government all my life. I'm used to the stability and security. You really think this is stable and secure? I was gonna mail it today if you didn't show up. Did you bring your friend some slippers, Cat? What did I go out there for? Why'd you turn it off? It sounds awful! Who are you mailing it to? You'll find out later. How's school? Everything okay? Same as always. Nothing ever changes. You seen Ming lately? She's fine! Just concentrate on your books. Me and Airplane will look after her. Chiung, come give me a hand. Uncle Fat's family will be here at 7:00. Clear the table, would you? Where's Sh'? I sent him to the movies. “The score with Sly will be settled by this day.” Sly? He hasn't come around in ages. He disappeared after he escaped the massacre. They fired his old man because of him. They hold political meetings in the auditorium, but outsiders can't rent it anymore. I got the worst of it. My business has gone to hell. The damn cops come round all the time. Closing up already? Shit! Look who's here! S? r. Jade said she's been seeing you at the library. You got kicked out of school too? You seem really different. Move your feet. I was really too much back then... wound up so tight all the time. It makes me laugh! Don't let the past get you down, okay? I feel really bad about it. Come on, man. It was all my fault. Let it go. What school are you trying to get into? I'm trying to test into day school. You got some balls! Even military academies won't take punks like me. You and I were such enemies. Now we're in the same boat. We even have the same bad luck with girlfriends. What do you mean? That Ma! He's really slick. I figure you'll be like me and not hold it against him. He stole Jade from me. Now he's messing around with Ming. When are you signing up for the exams? My math and English are the pits - S? r. Let's keep in touch. What was that for? You want trouble, asshole? Mess with me and I'll call the cops! Motherfucker! - Come on, forget it. - Who are you here to see? - Is Ma home? Wait here. What's your name? Si'r. Shit, it's been a long time! What have you been up to? That's what I want to ask you. I'm the same old me. What else? Hey, did you know Ming's living here now? Remember when you guys came over and our maid had quit? Ming came to my morn to see if her mother could fill the job. My morn really likes her and gave her mother the job. Ming's not bad. She's inside. Want to come in? What's this I hear about you and her? What do you mean? Girls. it's the same old shit. Dress 'em nice, feed 'em well, fool around a bit. What else is there? You don't look too happy. Don't let some stupid girl come between us, buddy. It's okay. When you two were fooling around, did she mention Honey a lot... and say you weren't giving her a sense of security? What's wrong? Don't get all worked up over some girl! Come on in. Let's shoot a few rounds. That's okay. I'm gonna catch a movie. - Got any money on you? - A little. How much? How much you need? Never mind. Look at it as meeting friends for dinner. Just be relaxed. Chuan, I need my watch. I put it back. Well, it's not here. Uncle Fat's here. - I want to go. - I'll bring you bubble gum. Lousy bubble gum! How many for dinner? Si'r is studying at the library. How about Lao Er? I don't know. He's had a good appetite lately. What's wrong? You're always outside whenever Mom's gone. Come eat your dinner! I'm not hungry yet. - You're asking for it! - I'm coming. - Is stealing Mom's watch a habit now? - I didn't take it. She noticed it was gone! What will you do now? What's this about? It's for grown-ups. Stay out of it. You're so mean! Where are you going? - Are your folks home? - They went out to dinner. - What's with Lao Er? - Oh, nothing. It's been ages. Are they doing all right? I'll come in a while and wait. Where are all the ashtrays? Dad quit smoking. You still using this thing? It's useless! You know, I took your dad to buy this radio. At the Wing On department store in Shanghai. Your morn wasn't even as old as you are now. You should throw that useless junk away. What were you doing at the church library? My sister told me about it. How about you? I play when it's time to play, study when it's time to study. So Chiung is your sister? She's really religious. We were both in the church choir at one point. What'll we do after the movie? - Some rock and roll joint? No, too expensive. You want to be like Ma? Don't be stupid. Didn't you quit? How about 300 a game? Shit! You need money that bad? This is a real opportunity for you. I was impressed with Mr. Lin. He's honest and direct. It's time to stop dragging your feet. Dad, Mr. Wang was here. I forgot your bubble gum! I'll make it up to you next time. Why the sad face? - Big sister bawled me out. She did? Were you naughty? No. Then why'd she do that? - Where's Lao Er? - He went out. Where'd he go? Little brat! Just had to snitch, didn't you! I saw Sly last night. He's totally changed. I guess people really do change. It was a comforting feeling. What are you going on about? Jade, can we be close to each other? I could help you feel that same way. Don't you need that sometimes? You're a serious one, aren't you? Didn't you look down on me before? Actually - Now you seem eager to change me. Am I your little biology experiment, or what? You have a lot of philosophical ideas. I'm happy with the way I am, but are you? What if I don't change? What if I don't change to suit your ideas? Will you just walk away? You're so selfish! Who do you think you are? Jade, I didn't mean any harm. By the way, thanks for the rumors you started back then. What rumors? Back when? Playing dumb? When the 217 boys cornered Sly at the school. Did you really not see it was Ming he was with? Sly was scared Honey might find out. He made me tell everyone it was me. I was such an idiot! Why don't you give Ming your philosophy lecture? She's got me beat by a mile. You're shameless! Hopeless! Tell your father you're sorry. That's enough, Dad. That's enough, Dad. That's enough! Dad, please stop! Please stop! You better come back later. Mom and Dad think you're studying at the library. If they find out you took the watch... they'll be even more heartbroken. Lao Er came up with a load of cash. He wanted to buy back the watch for you... but Mom found the money on him first. You mustn't feel alone. I'm always with you. Don't turn me away again. Let God into your heart. He'll give you his strength. But... there's too much suffering... too much injustice. Aren't you giving others too little credit and always thinking only of yourself? Christ gave his life for our sins. Even Lao Er took the blame for your wrongs. You should show gratitude for what others have done for you. Have you ever done anything for anyone? You should think it over carefully. Honey told me the same thing. Who? Never mind. A good friend. Have you ever read War and Peace ? Why don't you talk it over with Reverend Chen tomorrow? - What's up? - We're not finished yet. - What's this about? - Don't play dumb, asshole. Fuck you, going off on me over some girl! Aren't you my buddy? You go on like an old lady. You said you'd given up girls for books. Now you start bitching. You got some nerve! I've always been good to you. - Shut your mouth! Shut your mouth and listen good. I've had enough of your rich-kid theories. Starting today... if I hear you're still hanging out with Ming, I'm coming after you! Motherfuckin' punk! I let you be my best friend! Fuck! Don't forget who you're messing with! I'll be waitin' for you, buddy! I'll kick your ass! I've been looking all over for you. Cool it. We're all good friends. Cool it for my sake, okay? Let's talk it over. I'll bring him to you. Come on, man. Don't act this way. It makes us look bad. Wait at the film studio. I'll go talk to him. I'll bring him to you. Cool it for my sake. Come on, man. Let's drop it for today. I need time to talk to him. He brought his samurai sword to class. Let's do it tomorrow, okay? Go home and cool down. Do it for me, okay? Let's make it tomorrow, okay? Okay? For sure? I gotta go. I'm late for class. Your brother's not here yet? My family said he was on his way. Well... let's wait another half hour. - I'm sorry, Reverend Chen. - It's okay. Well... excuse me. Hey there! Can you help me find that young girl you were with before? She moved after the screen test. You know where to? She cries and laughs, and makes it all look natural! Natural? You can't even tell real from fake. How can you make movies? You even know what the hell you're filming? Cat's at school. I'm just borrowing a book. What book? I know where it is. How come his bike's still here? Strange. He's usually the first one out of here. Si?! What's the matter? What brings you here to school? What's that? Stop acting like this. What's that? You're here for Ma. Tell me! Are you? How could you do a thing like that? I won't let anyone look down on you. What are you talking about? Aren't you supposed to be home studying? Ming, I know all about you. But I don't mind. Because only I know. I'm the only one who can help you. I'm the only hope you have left. Just like Honey used to be. That's why you still can't forget Honey. Because right now, I'm another Honey. You mean you're the only one who can help change me, right? Why are you like all the rest? I was wrong about you. You're just like the others. You're nice to me just so I'll be nice to you.
