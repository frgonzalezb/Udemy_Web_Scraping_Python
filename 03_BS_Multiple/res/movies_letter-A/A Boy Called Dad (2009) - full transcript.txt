HEAVY BREATHING CONTINUES Can't you go on top? I've just had a double cheeseburger. I'd hurl. Just get on with it! Hurry up, or I'll miss me bus! Shit. I broke me nail! SPLASHING CHEERING Look, just calm down, will you, Jackie? Look, I can't get a word in edgeways here! This isn't what I had in mind, that's all. Oh, look, I feel stupid. Not only do I feel stupid, I look stupid! All the kids are just taking the piss. It's all right for you, I'd like to see you walking around like this. Oi! Come here, you, you little shit! Get here, you little shit! I'll have you when I get hold of you! What the bleedin' hell are you playing at, soft lad? I could've killed you then! Dad? - What? - It's me. - Who? - Robbie. - My Robbie?

You haven't seen the last of me! Think he's topped himself! HE LAUGHS So what's the score with Mr Whippy, then? - Me and me mates were messin'. Borrowed his van. - Borrowed? We were gonna give it back. Stalled it. The others legged it. Shocking. Rule number one. If you're gonna be the getaway driver, don't stall the car. - Thought you lived in Ireland. - Yeah, I do. I'm just over here doin' a job for a mate, you know. Been over here before? Why do you sound like a Manc? - Lived in Manchester with our Katie's dad. - You've got a sister? - Pain in the arse. - How come you're here, then? Mum and Terry split up. How old are you now, mate? 14. How come you never came to see us? Yeah, I would've if I could, but, you know, it's complex, you know what I mean, with Ireland and that. - How long you here for now? - Not long. Look, I've just got to see a man about a horse. You stay here, though, right? I won't be long. RACING COMMENTARY Come on, come on, come on. Get in! Thought he was gonna bottle it, then. The patron saint of jockeys must have been looking after you today, you jammy get. Hee-hee! Cheers, Billiam. - Happy days, lad! - D'you always win? Oh, aye, yeah. Apart from when I lose. Mum reckons it's a mug's game. Yeah? Then you won't want this off this mug. Here you go. Go on. - You won it. - It's yours. What's mine's yours. - Will I see you again? - Course. You on the front tomorrow? Same time? Yeah. Maybe not a good idea to let on to your mum that you've seen me here. I won't. All right. Cheer up! Mine went further. - Like that? - And the chips go in. That's marvellous. Step two. And then the, you know... Thanks very much. The piece de resistance... is the curry sauce, which I can't open. One sec. Oh, it's all over the show now! Here you go, have a bit of that. There we go. Jamie Oliver, my arse, mate. BABY CRIES - Do you know her? - No. - Which way's Ireland? - Perch Rock and take a left. On a clear day, you can see Val Doonican. Who? You know, Val Doonican. # Walk tall, walk tall and look the world right in the eye. # You laughin' at me? Ah, he's made a happy man very old. - Are there any nice girls in Killarney? - Oh, yeah. Want me to put a word in for you? Don't worry, I'll make sure that, y'know, she's got all the bits. You with anyone? No. Maybe you could come back to live with us. The chances of that are poor to piss poor, son. Your mum'd never have me back. She might change her mind. Women do - it's a well-known fact. - Yeah? Not your mum. - SHIP HORN BLARES I'm always lookin' out for you on that. - Sometimes I reckon I've seen you on it. - Yeah? - D'you remember a snow globe you got me? - Snow globe? It had a nativity in it. Cracked. Yeah! Yeah, I do remember it now, yeah. Mary's head fell off, we stuck it back on with Bostick. - You can see the join. - The thought that counts. - You kept that all this time? - The snow doesn't snow. Never did. Snow's overrated anyway. Kept this an' all. I remember that day. Bits of it. I was havin' a banana milkshake. We were in that cafe at Hollyhead. Before we got the train home. Why did you leave us? Your mum never told you? She doesn't talk about it. Just says you let us down. Better off without you. Yeah, maybe she's right. I don't feel better off without you. D'you ever think about me dad? Not if I can help it. Why? He might've changed. Yeah. And there's a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow. You don't know nothing, you. You're full of shit. You ever wonder why you're on your own? NOLAN! Dive in, or get down. JEERING Come on, Nolan! < Can't drive and he can't dive! Mr Skinner? Are you Mr Skinner? Yeah, you don't know me. I'm his dad. LAUGHTER NOLAN! Dive in or get down, lad! - Hey! Did you do that? - Yeah! - What the bleedin' hell are you playin' at? - You said you'd meet me! - I know, but something came up and I'm sorry. No need for that, though, was there? Going to cost a few bob to get that fixed. Oh, eh! - Robbie, where you going? - Mum said you were a loser. - Cheers(!) - Always was, always will be! - At least I'm consistent. ENGINE REVS All right, I'm a loser. I'll make it up to you. - Forget it. - Come on, give us a chance. I said forget it. Go back to Ireland, I'm not arsed. All right, I'll piss off, but let me do one thing first. HE HONKS HORN It's Robbie. Thought I couldn't drive! - Hungry? - Starving. Viagra? What the bloody hell d'you want Viagra for? You're 81 years of age, for Christ's sake! You'll be pole vaulting all the way to that daycare centre, if you're not careful. Sheila? Home Help Sheila? Dad! The only thing she's trying to get her hands on is your pension! Is she there? If she's there, put her on. Put her on! Listen, you. If you don't keep your filthy mitts off him, I'm going to come round there and shove that can of Mr Sheen so far up your arse, it'll take you a fortnight to shit it out. Do you hear me? - Salt and vinegar, love? - Please. Hey! Get out! What are you doing, you cheeky little twat?! What did you see in me mum? I didn't. I fancied her mate, Josie. She had bigger tits. She had a gob to match, though, so I sacked that idea. What you reckon she saw in you? I could dance. There's three things women love. One, a man who can dance. Two, a man who'll listen. The trick with that is to pretend you're listening when you're not. And, three, always agree with everything they've said, even when they're wrong. Simple. - I can't dance. - Everyone can dance. - I can't. Get out. Go on, get out. Go on, I'll teach you a few moves. Just go from side to side. Oh, what?! One, two, three, four. One, two three. MUSIC: "The Snake" by Al Wilson That's good! You're getting there. Feeling it, yeah. Then you've go to and get your fancy moves. Do your high kicks. Come on, feel it. In time to the music. Something like that. Get the basics right and everything else will follow. Tell you what, mate... just stick to two and three. How come you can dance and I can't? Dunno. Take after me dad. Your grandad. What was he like? - Do you want to be buried or cremated? - Surprise me. - 'Bout you? - Neither. They reckon drowning's a good way to go, don't they? Dunno, never tried it. - D'you reckon he can hear us? - Doubt it. - He was deaf! - HE LAUGHS - Are you like him? - He was the talk of the village, me dad. Always tellin' stories. Used to sit us on his knee - and tell us all about the old days in Killarney. - How old were you? 29! Nah, dunno, four or five. Used to take us there in the school holidays. - Took us to the Blarney Stone. - What's that? - If you kiss it, it's meant to give you the gift of the gab. - So you'll have better luck chattin' up girls. - Did it work? - Yeah. - Shagged this girl called Mary there. - On the Blarney Stone? - Yeah. Me dad went mental. But I could tell he was thinking, "Nice one, son". You're meant to look up to your dad. I did. He was a hero. Are you like him? Come on. It's getting cold. - Leanne! - What do you want? - Can I hold him? - No! - Please, just for a bit? - Why are you suddenly arsed about him? You don't even know his name. Buy him some nappies. That wouldn't even buy him one. It's all I've got. Please? - Will it mean you'll leave us alone? - Yeah. Like that, divvy! He's not a sack of spuds. Hey, mate. It's Elliott. Hi, Elliott. His first name's William after my granddad. Billy Elliott? CAR SPEEDS BY TYRES SCREECH Just stay away, Robbie, OK? BABY CRIES - Who's that kid? - Just someone from school.

Liverpool. - His home's in Ireland. - I think you've got your wires crossed, lad. He lives in Liverpool. - How long's he lived there for? - Years. If you're his son, shouldn't you know that? Yeah. It's just we've been apart for a bit. - Has he been over here much? - On and off, yeah. - No message? - No. TRAIN PASSES DOOR SLAMS BABY CRIES Fucking shut up. Fucking shut up!

He'd like to be. He's older. Only chance I get to talk to lads. My dad won't let me. Treats me like a kid. Can't go anywhere on my own, except the farm. Maybe he just wants to look after you? How would you like it? He wants to meet me. Be careful, Nia. He could be some paedo. - He's not. - How do you know? Could be some old perv. You don't want to be doing it with some old fella. What's up? I'm going to stay here until you tell me. Uncle Barry. My dad's brother. Smelt of... the pub and fish paste sandwiches. He said... He said if I ever told anyone, that my dad would die as well, so be good. It was cos I hadn't been good that my mum died. On my 12th birthday, my dad caught him. I've never seen him again and my dad won't have his name mentioned. I got pregnant. I didn't want it. You need to talk to someone. I am. CAR ON CATTLE GRID Shit. Your dad! I'll see you later.
