What special thing I brought in to show you? It's called a picture board. Because behind each one of these little doors is a picture of people. Lady Aberlin. Let's see who's behind this door. It's King Friday the thirteenth, with his crown and mustache and beard. Who's behind here? It's Mister McFeely. He always says "speedy delivery", doesn't he? I'd like you to meet a new friend of mine. His name is Lloyd Vogel. Someone has hurt my friend Lloyd. And not just on his face. He is having a hard time forgiving the person who hurt him. Do you know what that means, to forgive? It's a decision we make to release a person from the feelings of anger we have at them. It's strange, but sometimes it's hardest of all to forgive someone we love. Let's go say hello to my new friend Lloyd, shall we? ♪ I never felt magic crazy as this ♪ ♪ I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea ♪ ♪ I never held emotion in the palm of my hand ♪ ♪ Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree ♪ ♪ But now you're here ♪ ♪ Brighten my northern sky ♪ Here to present this year's award for Feature Writing. Please welcome last year's winner Lloyd Vogel. Thank you. It's so wonderful to be among so many of my fellow misfits tonight. So, why do we write for magazines for a living? Honestly, because doing anything else doesn't seem quite like living at all. We get a front row seat to history. We get to expose the truth that others cannot see. And sometimes, just sometimes, we get to change a broken world with our words. Thank you. I needed this. I ate a block of cheese for dinner. So, what are we forgetting? We definitely need more diapers. More than this? We're going to Jersey for one night. We go through at least twelve a day. We do? What are you feeding that kid? Wouldn't it be easier if we left him with a sitter? You know I'm not ready to leave him with a stranger, okay? He's too little. Yeah. Hey, your sister called last night. She wanted to make sure you'd written your toast. Oh, I'm all set. I'm just gonna use my speech from her first wedding. - Or maybe from her second. - Oh, yeah! Just change the names. And hey, she wanted me to tell you something. Okay... Your father is coming. I guess she reached out to him a couple of months ago, and he didn't respond, but, then he called, and now he's coming to the wedding. Are you okay? Yeah! I'm fine. But I don't think we should go. - Lloyd! - What? Seriously, why have a baby if you can't use him to get out of social obligations? This is what Lorraine was afraid of, that you would back out. I'm kidding. I'm not gonna miss her wedding. I look forward to them every year. Okay. I think it'll be nice for Gavin to meet his grandfather. Sure. Dammit! Daddy's just being funny. Daddy's being funny. That's impossible. Here. Take him. Here. There. Great. He looks terrified. He should be. He's marrying Lorraine. Oh my God! You look beautiful. Absolutely. Well, I'm ten pounds short of my target weight, but whatever. Lloyd. The brother. I know, man. I guess I'm Todd, you know, the husband. And look at you, ya little peanut. I don't think we're having any kids. How did that happen? I invited him and he came. To walk you down the aisle? Really? He offered. He missed the first two, I thought "why the hell not?". I can think of a few reasons why. He's old, and if he's gonna try to make an effort... Oh, I guess it's time we get this started. So, in lieu of the typical father of the bride speech, I thought I'd... Well, I'd like to sing a little ditty. This is for my Lorraine and for you too... And for Todd. ♪ I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me ♪ ♪ And if we go some place to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me ♪ ♪ Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two ♪ Admit it. Now you wish we hadn't eloped. He's drunk. Oh, well. He can sing. ♪ I love you ♪ ♪ I love you ♪ ♪ I love you ♪ Here we are. In the pearl of the Garden State. Hello, Jerry. Oh, come on! You don't have to call me Jerry. Or call me Jerry. I don't care. And hello to you! Hi, I'm Andrea. Lloyd's wife. Andrea! Of course! What a unique pleasure. Hello, little fella. This is Gavin. What a handsome man! You look just like me. Let's get a drink? What's this stuff? A pop? This stuff will kill you. I'm just giving my toast, and then we're leaving, so... Doll, could you give us a moment? She's not a doll. She's a public interest attorney. Where the money in that? You know what? We're gonna circulate. You got a baby. And a wife. You happy? I'm happy. Well, she seems nice enough, but I mean, aren't you a little old to have a baby? I'm not that old. You're smart. Your mom and I hardly knew each other when she got pregnant. We were babies. Don't talk about her! Wait a minute. You don't know the whole story. Your mom really was not the saint... Don't talk about my mom! - Come on? - Get off me! What the hell? You didn't hear him. You were out of control. He was out of control! You just not gonna take responsibility for any of this? Of course, I am! I offered to pay for Lorraine's dry cleaning. Have you ever felt the way Lloyd does? So angry you want to hurt someone? Or at yourself? I know I have. When I was a boy I was very chubby. And the other kids would chase me and call me names, like "Fat Freddy". It made me very sad. Sometimes, when I was by myself, I would cry. And other times, it made me very angry. There is always something you can do with the mad that you feel. Did you hear that? Someone is at my door. Let's go see who it is. It's Mr. McFeely. Speedy delivery. Look. It's a magazine. Thank you. Magazines are always so full of interesting information. They sure are. My friend Lloyd works for a magazine. He's a very wonderful writer. That reminds me. I have a video I found, and I thought you and your neighbor may like to see it. What is it? It's about how people make a magazine. It's called "How People Make a Magazine". I know lots of people like magazines, so I thought you might find this interesting. I think we would, but do you have time to show it to us now? I'd be glad to see it again. Let's look at it on Picture Picture. We'll watch it on Picture Picture and see how people make a magazine. Now, this is the ink they use in the printing press that prints the magazines. Yellow ink. It looks like mustard. And these are large rolls of blank paper, that are getting loaded into the machine. I wonder how many magazines they can make out of one of those large rolls. They print the magazines in giant sheets. One color at a time. This machine assembles the magazine, and glues it all together. Oh, now, who's this? These are the people who decide what will be in the magazine. They pick the pictures and design the layout. Oh, that's an important job. And these are the people who write the words that go into a magazine. It's a lot of work to make a magazine, isn't it? It certainly is. Yeah. Pay no attention to my face. Softball injury. Nothing to worry about. Good morning, Ellen. How are you? - This should be interesting. - What should? Sending you on an assignment with your face all busted up. - An assignment? - Yep. You're the perfect person for it. You just had a baby. Why are you giving me an assignment? We're doing an issue on heroes, and we're profiling a number of inspirational people. We just need a small piece of copy to accompany a pretty photo. You hired me as an investigative journalist. I don't do puff pieces. Wait a second, didn't I hire you to do whatever I tell you to do? And right now that's doing a profile on one of our nation's heroes. Who? Mister Rogers. As in the hokey kid's show guy? As in the beloved children's television host, yes. Look, I think this could help you, Lloyd. Just, start to change your image. I don't need to change my image. Okay. Ellen? He was the only person on our list willing to be interviewed by you, Lloyd. I guess you're developing a reputation. A reputation? People love talking to me. Yeah, they do. Until they read what you write about them. So what? I'm supposed to go easy on this guy because he plays with puppets for a living? 400 words. Play nice. Hello, this is Lloyd Vogel, from Esquire Magazine. I'm calling to schedule an interview with Mister Rogers. Sorry about your face. You know, I got it good too. Look, I messed this up. I just want to talk to you. We have a lot that needs to be said. No. I'm not gonna be ambushed. Come on, Lloyd. Hi, honey. - Hi. Hi guys. - Hi, Lloyd. Smells in here. Bathroom trash. Nine different types of diapers. Hey, Lloyd. I got it. Hello? Lloyd? Who's this? This is Fred Rogers. Hi. That was quick. Well, I figured if you want to talk to me, I should want to talk to you. Yeah, I just wanted to set a time to sit with you and ask you a few questions. I'm happy to schedule something, except for one thing. What's that? You have me here right now. Okay. Sure. On our program, I try to look through the camera into the eyes of a single child, and speak to him, or her, trying to be fully present to their feelings and their needs. Right. Do you know what the important thing in the world is to me right now? No. Talking on the telephone to Lloyd Vogel. Hey. Hey. You okay? I got an assignment. Where are you going this time? Pittsburgh, tomorrow. I'm profiling Mister Rogers. Really? I love him. - You do? - Yeah. Why? I don't know. Wait, Ellen is giving you a profile? She knows that's not what you do. I think that's her point. Can you say no? Can you take some time and be with us for a while? You didn't take off any time when Gavin was born. Not really. At least it's someone good. Yeah. We'll see. Oh God, Lloyd. Please don't ruin my childhood. Hey, I'm looking for Fred Rogers. Who? Am I in the wrong place? I know who you are. In here. You'll get about twenty minutes with him during the break. I was told an hour. You're not gonna try to fight him, are you? Oh, softball league. Play at the plate. Maybe you shouldn't have led with your face. Sorry, guy. Could be a minute. Is this a Make-a-Wish thing? How are we doing, Margy? He's ruining my life. How long? Half-hour already, which puts us... 73 minutes behind. Yikes. I gotta go in. Cover me. You're on your own. ...color of sweater that I do, but I can't see colors very well, isn't that funny? Look at that. I'm sorry. Son, he's talking to you. All right. Don't do that, sweetheart. That sword looks awfully sharp, and heavy too. - Not really. - No? Well, you must be very strong in order to hold it like that. And I bet you are very strong on the inside, too. Oh, I'd love that. I'm terribly sorry, Fred. We need to start. Can I take your picture? Everybody make sure you can see me. Thank you. Thank you so much for coming down and visiting us in the neighborhood. Folks, if you'll follow me. How often does this happen? Every day. Okay here we go! Everybody settle. Quiet please. Roll sound. - Sound speeds. - Mark it. And, action. Do you know what this is? It's... Lloyd! Lloyd! Hold please! We can't fire him, can we? Hello, Lloyd. It's nice to meet you. Are you all right? Play at the plate. It looks like it hurts. Let's chat afterwards? - We need to keep moving. - We could have Evan take look at him? No, I'm good. I'm sorry, Fred, we need to... Okay, all right. It's wonderful to meet you, I'm so glad you're here, Lloyd, I'm looking forward to talking with you. I truly am. After this. Everyone, this is Lloyd Vogel. He is a wonderful writer. Thank you, Fred. Okay, resetting. Step over here. Roll sound. Sound speeds. And slate. And action! Do you know what this is? It's a tent. Let's set it up. Mercy. Little bit trickier than I thought. I can't. I can't do it. It must take two grown-ups to set up a tent. And that's a cut. Let's go again. No, let's... Let's look at that. Okay, roll playback, please. You know, we could pre-set a tent for you. No, I think this is good. Yeah. I think we're okay. Good, that's lunch everybody. The tent. Why didn't you let them set it up for you? Children need to know that even when adults make plan, sometimes, they don't turn out the way we'd hoped. How long have you been married, Lloyd? Eight years. That's a wonderful accomplishment. Does your spouse have a name? Andrea. I would like to meet Andrea some day. I'm sure. You've lived in Pittsburgh your whole life? I grew up not too far from here in a town called Latrobe, but we've lived here for quite some time, and we've raised our boys here. Do you think living here makes it easier or more difficult to be a celebrity? Celebrity? Mercy. You don't consider yourself famous? Fame is a four letter word, like tape, or zoom, or face. What ultimately matters is what we do with it. And what are you doing with it? We are trying to give children positive ways to deal with their feelings. This piece will be for an issue about heroes. Do you consider yourself a hero? I don't think of myself as a hero. No, not at all. What about "Mister Rogers"? Is he a hero? I don't understand the question. There's you, Fred, and then there's the character you play, Mister Rogers. You said it was a play at the plate. Is that what happened to you? What did happened to you, Lloyd? I got into a fight. Oh my. Who did you get into a fight with? It's not important. Jerry. And who is Jerry? My father. Oh my. I'd rather not talk about it. What were you and your father fighting about? I'm here to interview you, Mr. Rogers. Well, that is what we're doing, isn't it? We're ready for you in studio B, Fred. Okay, Margy. I thought we had twenty minutes. Can I take your picture? I like to take pictures of people that I meet so then I can show them to Joanne later on. Thank you so much. I do hope you'll stick around. I really do. That's it? Daniel, are you set? I'm set. Thank you, Daniel. Did she just talk to the puppet? Daniel isn't just a puppet. Daniel is Fred, and Fred is Daniel. You mean... Please stop talking. Let me know when you're ready, Lattie. Okay. Thank you. And Trolley. Action. Hello, Lady Aberlin. Hi, Daniel. Are you making that funny smell? Do you mean that skunk kinda smell? No, I'm trying to help that smell go away. By squirting another smell? That's right. A sweet smelling smell. Wanna smell? Okay. That does smell good. Where did the bad smell come from? Mister Skunk. He got scared, and he just sprayed this smell all over me. Oh no! Did he say he was sorry? No. And that just makes me so very mad! And I don't know what to do. Oh, Daniel. ♪ What do you do with the mad that you feel? ♪ ♪ When you feel so mad you could bite ♪ ♪ When the whole wide world seems oh so wrong ♪ ♪ And nothing you do seems very right ♪ ♪ What do you do? Do you punch a bag? ♪ ♪ Do you pound some clay or some dough? ♪ ♪ Do you round up friends for a game of tag or see how fast you go? ♪ ♪ I can stop when I want to.

Thank you, Daniel. - I feel better. - I'm so glad. I just don't know if he's for real. That's not for you to say, Lloyd. I think with a few more interviews... No, no, no. I told you, this isn't an exposé, okay? Just, please, put pen to paper. A couple of funny anecdotes. Keep it simple. I can't do that, Ellen. He's a lot more complex than I thought. He's a children's entertainer. He's Mister freaking Rogers. This isn't Mikhail Gorbachev we're talking about. I don't think you understand what you're asking of me. I'm asking you to do your job, Now, get out of here and come back to me when you have your first draft. This gives new meaning to "boys in the hoooood". We'll be back with Mister Rogers! - Hey. - Hi. How'd it go? He's just about the nicest person I've ever met. When you say it it doesn't sound like a compliment. There is an attitude out there, there are some things going on, there's a lot of hopelessness. What do we need to do? There are no simple answers, of course, but if we could, through television programs, as well as every other imaginable program, let people know that each one of us is precious. It all starts in the home. We can never underrate how important that is. I don't think that anybody can grow unless he really is accepted exactly as he is. If somebody is always saying to a child "you're gonna grow up and you're gonna be fine". So much of that in this country already. - It's your turn. - Yup. A child is appreciated for what he "will be", not for what he "is". He will be a great consumer someday. So, the quicker we can get them out of the nest, so they can go out and buy, then the better. What do you think is the biggest mistake parents make in raising their children? Not to remember their old childhood. Yeah. I think that the best thing that we can do is to think about what it was like for us, and know what our children are going through. But you know what, it's so hard once you get to be a parent, you always say "I will never do this", when your mother's doing it to you or your father's doing it to you. You say "I will never do this to my child". And then you get to our age, and you forget what it was like to be this size, you really do forget. But those children can help re-evoke what it was like. That's why when you're a parent you have a new chance to grow. You do? Did you ever, I can't imagine, I know that you are the father of two boys, but I can't imagine you ever having a problem with your children. You ever have any? Well, of course, I'm a human being, just like everybody else... I thought you would just talk to them and say "Can you say good morning"? And they would change. But, you know, a lot of people do those parodies... ♪ Well I left my happy home to see what I could find out ♪ ♪ I left my folk and friends with the aim to clear my mind out ♪ ♪ Well I hit the rowdy road and many kinds I met there ♪ ♪ And many stories told me on the way to get there ♪ ♪ So on and on I go, the seconds tick the time out ♪ ♪ So much left to know, and I'm on the road to find out ♪ Hello.

It can't be easy him traveling with Gavin at home. Thank you for saying that. I'm gonna give Lloyd to you now. Mister Rogers knows my name! This is Lloyd. You left without getting to say goodbye, so I'm glad we get to continue to talk. I'm going to New York City today to film, and Joanne is coming with me. We thought you might like to come down and say hello. How much time do you think I'll have with him today? You're here because Fred wants you here. Honored. He likes everybody, but he loves people like you. People like me? I've read your work. You don't really care for humanity, do you? I'm just doing my job. I insisted he read you before we agreed. And did he? Every article we could find. Oh thank you. That made me wanna get up and do a little dance. We have a surprise for you, Mister Rogers. We gonna play one of your songs, called "You are Special". How wonderful! How do you play your instruments without your bows? Well, we can play pizzicato, which means we're going to pluck the strings with our fingers. Hello everybody. Nice to see you. I call this move the handshake hand off. That's quite a skill. We stole Bill from the governor's office fourteen years ago. Have you got a chance to know him yet? Love Bill. Big fan. He is very protective of Roge. You call him Roge? I don't call him Mister Rogers at home, dear. Joanne Rogers. - Nice to meet you. - You as well, dear. How does it feel to be married to a living saint? I'm not fond of that term. If you think of him as a saint, then his way of being is unattainable. He works at it all the time. It's a practice. He's not a perfect person. He has a temper. He chooses how he responds to that anger. That must take a lot of effort. Well, he does things every day that help ground him. Reads scripture, swims laps. Prays for people by name. Writes letters, hundreds of them. He's been doing that since I met him. Thank you so much. Thank you folks for coming out. - My love. - Bye, my love. We'll see you in just a few hours. Lloyd, I thought you and I would spend some time together. Of course. Do you always take the subway? Joanne and I have an apartment. It's just a few stops away. It's the easiest way to get around sometimes. You've covered some heavy stuff, especially for a show aimed at children. I'm glad you had a chance to view the program. Death, divorce, war. It gets dark. You know, Maggie Stewart showed me the most beautiful word in sign language. Do you know what that means? It means "friend". Isn't that perfect? Who's Maggie Stewart?

It seems like all these people line up to tell you their problems. Isn't it wonderful? Such bravery. It seems like that would be an incredible burden on you. I'm grateful for you saying that, Lloyd. I'm grateful for your compassion. Is it a burden on you? Okay. Let's assume it's a burden on you. There's no normal life that is free from pain. How do you deal with that? There are many ways you can deal with your feelings without hurting yourself or anybody else. Yeah, like what? You can pound a lump of clay. Or swim as fast as you can swim. Or play the lowest keys on the piano all at the same time. Did you ever talk to anyone about the burden you carry? Would you like to meet my special puppet friends from The Neighborhood of Make Believe? They look like they've seen better days. They've been with me for quite a while. You ever think about swapping them out, getting new ones? Didn't you have a special friend when you were very young, Lloyd? - A special friend? - Special toy. Or a stuffed animal that you loved very much, even as it got ratty and worn-out, it made you just love it all the more? I don't know, I'm sure I did. Can you tell me about your special friend? I think I had a rabbit. Did your rabbit have a name? It was just rabbit. It was Old Rabbit. And who gave you Old Rabbit? My mom. She must love you very much. That she did. She died when I was young. I'm sure that if she saw you today, the person you have become, she would be proud of you. I want to get back to my questions. You wanted to meet my special friends from the Neighborhood of Make Believe. No. I asked about the burden you carry. I am King Friday the thirteenth. Lloyd Vogel the journalist, I presume? And here's Daniel Striped Tiger. Sometimes, Daniel is too shy to talk. But that's okay, Daniel. Have you met Daniel? Not officially. No. I'd like to meet Old Rabbit. I don't wanna talk about Old Rabbit, I gotta say. Maybe Lloyd doesn't feel like talking today, Daniel. And that's okay. Can you put the puppet down, Fred? You stopped making the show in the mid-seventies for three years. Why'd you quit? At that point I felt the program had covered all the major facets of childhood. And what brought you back? Money? Boredom? My sons had grown into teenagers. And were struggling. We all were. I realized then that there were still much more to talk about. I can't imagine it was easy, growing up with you as a father. Until recently, my oldest never told people about me. He's very private, and that's okay. And my younger son, he genuinely tested me. But, eventually, we found our way. And now I'm very proud of both of them. But you are right, Lloyd. It couldn't have been easy on them. Thank you. Thank you for that perspective. You're welcome. Is that not the answer you were hoping for? Being a parent does not mean being a perfect parent. You might be experiencing some of that now, with your son. I've been thinking a lot about you and your father. Did you work out your disagreement? This is ridiculous. Lloyd, where are you going? We're done. Thanks. It's been a real pleasure. Mercy. Hey hey. C'mon, sit down. We cooked you some take-out. They brought pizza. Lloyd, this is Dorothy. Hello. Can't you just say hello? Where are your manners? I'm sorry. I think we should go. I had an idea, okay? We'd eat some food, we'd talk like people. I messed things up at the wedding. Of course, you know, you didn't help, but I get it. Then, you let me sit out there in my car on the street for two nights like I'm homeless, like I'm some kind of a bum. - Jerry, you're not helping. - He won't say a word! You came here to introduce me to her? Dorothy. Hi, Dorothy. Hi, Lloyd. Okay, you did what you came here to do. Now I want you to leave. Lloyd! I may never come back here, so, please listen to me. Dorothy and I have been together and in love for fifteen years. He left as soon as Mom got sick, did you know that? Couldn't even wait for her to die. She really didn't want me there. 'Cause you were sleeping around while she was dying. I know. I know it! It took me years to get myself together. Dorothy is why I'm standing here. She helped me grow the hell up. You know what they tell you about people, when they are dying? They tell you it's peaceful. That they just slip away. Mom screamed as she went, did you know that? She screamed until she passed out. And then they came in and revived her, and she went right back to it. It was just me, Lorraine and the nurses! Sign the paperwork. Pack up the house. Put her in the ground. - Jerry. - Come on, Lloyd. My jaw. Jerry. Jerry! Oh, Jerry, Oh my God! - I'll call 911. - Lloyd, do something! - Is he breathing? - Yeah, he's breathing. Lloyd, do something! The cardiac MRI revealed more extensive stenosis than we thought. An operation at this time... The risk of infection alone... You know anything? I hate hospitals. You should go home and get him to bed. I don't wanna leave you here. I'm not staying here. Okay. Let's all go together. No. I have to go to Pittsburgh. Right now? Yeah, I have to work. With your dad like this? I have a deadline. Yeah, I'm sure Ellen would understand if you tell her what's happening. I don't want to. I wanna go to Pittsburgh. I wanna do my job. This shouldn't be a surprise to you. Don't talk to me like that. You seem to think that now that we have a kid I shouldn't care about all the things I have always cared about just because you don't anymore. Well, I still care about my work. I have never asked you to stop caring about your work. I've gotta go. Why? Everyone who is important is in this hospital right now. Can't you be on my side for once? You used to be on my side. I am telling you this because I am on your side. Now is not the time to go work. I gotta go, if I'm gonna make Pittsburgh by morning. Fine. I'm gonna go sit with your family, while you go. Pittsburgh? Lloyd! There you are. Hey, I need to talk to Fred. Very funny, mister. Get over there. We're ready to shoot. Right this way. Come here. Quiet please. What? What am doing here? You're in this episode, of course. Just wait there. - Roll sound. - Sound speeds. And slate. And... Action. Oh, it's my good friend, Lloyd. Lloyd Vogel. - You remember Lloyd? - Fred, I don't understand what's going on. Can we stop? Are you feeling unwell? Stop asking me questions. I ask you questions. On today's program I thought we would talk about hospitals. Sometimes when somebody is sick, - they have to go to a hospital. - I hate hospitals. A hospital is a place where people go. Okay. Would you like to pretend we're at a hospital? No! Hello, Old Rabbit. What? Old Rabbit, I presume? I'm not... I don't... Where's Fred? I've been waiting to meet you, Old Rabbit. I'm so happy you came for a visit. Hello, Lady Aberlin. Well hello. Hello, Old Rabbit. Oh my God. We were discussing hospitals. Well, a hospital is where you go when your body is hurt, but what do you do when your feelings are hurt? Well, you talk about them. ♪ It's good to talk.

My goodness, if I knew you were there, I would've stopped all this noise. No, no. That was beautiful. You must be very hungry, Lloyd. Let me get my jacket, and we'll go out. I should go. No, nonsense. Look at this. Thank you so much. Enjoy. Thank you. Are you a vegetarian? I just can't imagine eating anything with a mother. Bill was right. You love people like me. What are people like you? I've never met anyone like you in my entire life. Broken people. I don't think you are broken. I know you are a man of conviction. A person, who knows the difference between what is wrong, and what is right. Try to remember that your relationship with your father also helped to shape those parts. He helped you become what you are. Would you do something with me, Lloyd? It's an exercise I like to do sometimes. We'll take a minute, and think about all the people who loved us into being. I can't do that. They will come to you. Just one minute of silence. Thank you for doing that with me. I feel so much better. So, the way I left... Was messed up. Yes. I should've called you. You shouldn't have left. The doctor came out to speak to you, I didn't know what to tell her. I really didn't know what to tell your dad. And on top of that, I tried to get a cab home, of course, I couldn't get one, so had I took a train, at midnight. People were looking at me with Gavin like... Someone was gonna call Child Services. I know you're trying to apologize, but that doesn't mean it gets to be easy. Okay, talk. Can we sit? Is he down? Finally. Listen... I realize I need to deal with my feelings. When I'm scared, which I was in the hospital, and I... I have been for a long time, I get really angry. And I know it's a way of saying "I can't deal with this get away from me". But that's not what I want. That's, actually, the opposite of what I want. You and Gavin... You're what I want. I'm sorry. I have to go and see Jerry. He's dying. I know. My dad is dying. Celia Sherman. Colby Dickerson. Justin Cook. Rebecca Aniton. Lloyd Vogel. Andrea Vogel. Gavin Vogel. Jerry Vogel. Thank you, God. He still eats like a teenager. Cold cuts, sugar cereal. Stubborn goat. At least you come by it honestly. Did you know about me and my sister? Not until very recently. What about my mom? When he got sick last year, the first episode, he... He started to talk, and tell me things I wish he'd told me a long time ago. We got bourbon, you know. Someone should drink it. No thanks. Not even beer? Do you have a beer? Yeah I... I'll drink a beer if it will make you happy. No. I don't have a beer. And don't do it because it'd make me happy. Do it 'cause you wanna do it. You don't have a beer and I don't wanna beer. So, don't drink anything. Dehydrate. Sorry. I definitely broke the Pack 'n Play. It just snapped like a chicken bone. How is he doing? He seems fine. I don't know. They don't put a hospital bed in your living room if you're fine. Hey, thank you for coming. You're gonna love the sofa bed. - Yeah? - No. Okay. Come here. I know. I know. I know, you wish it was your mom who was awake right now. I know. But we're gonna let her sleep, okay? I'm gonna get better at this. And we're gonna have to get used to each other. ♪ I like you as you are ♪ ♪ Exactly and precisely ♪ ♪ I think you turned out nicely ♪ ♪ I like you as you are ♪ ♪ Without a doubt or question ♪ Who's that? Dorothy? Come on. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. It's four in the morning. I don't sleep much these days. You don't sleep either, do you? I never did this with you. Up in the middle of the night, doing the mom thing. It's not a mom thing. You know what I mean. You should rest. No, stay. Hey. Right over there. What? Just grab two glasses. I don't think that's the best idea. How would you know? You don't drink. Come on. Now we're talking. Cheers. Lloyd. I am sorry for leaving you and your sister. It was selfish. And it was cruel. Will you look at me? I am so sorry, son. It's not fair, you know? I think I'm just now starting to figure out how to live my life. I've always loved you. I love you too, Dad. What? It's stupid. It's like ten thousand words. Yeah. It's not really about Mister Rogers. I know. I mean it is, but it's so you. You never talk about this stuff. Nope. It's good. - Yeah? - Yeah. Lloyd. I love it. You do? Yes. It's gonna be the cover. Right off the bat, about the wedding... Whatever, It was the most entertaining one yet. I'm just glad you're here. Don't go to Martha's Vineyard. Why not? It's my honeymoon. I deserve it. Absolutely you do. No, it's not a question of entitlement. You're not gonna like it. It's a buncha rich jerks, and it's freezing. You're gonna freeze to death with a buncha rich jerks. Who's here? Ah, I'm in the right place. - Come on in. - Lloyd. Holy crap. Andrea? Hi Fred. Such a pleasure to finally see you. - Can I take this for you? - Oh, thank you. Hello, Mister Rogers. Hello. Hi Gavin, hello, I hope you and I can be friends someday. Mr. Vogel. May I call you Jerry? Yes sir, you certainly may. Lloyd, Joanne adored your article, as did I. Andrea, are you feeling better about daycare? A little. Maybe. What? You're not the only one who talks to Fred. Mister Rogers, is it true you are a sharp shooter? Navy Seal! No, I'm afraid not. What, the hell, kind of an insane question was that? I heard it. Andrea, where did you guys go on your honeymoon? We eloped in Maui, so we were kinda already on our honeymoon. - I would've gone. - You weren't invited. Lloyd is embarrassed by us. - I'm kidding. - I know. Maybe, we should do a family vacation. What do you think about that, Dad? Should we dip our toes in the ocean together? That sounds so nice. Crash your honeymoon? Count me in, If I'm still here. You know, death is something many of us are uncomfortable speaking about. But to die is to be human. And anything human is mentionable, anything mentionable is manageable. Anything mentionable is manageable. You gotta send me a copy. Joanne would love this when she sees it. It'd be so much cooler if he was in this. Thank you. I should get going. I'll walk you out. Count on it. Thank you. Hey, what did you say to Jerry? I asked him to pray for me. I figure anyone who's going through what he's going through must be awfully close to God. - Lloyd. - Bill.
