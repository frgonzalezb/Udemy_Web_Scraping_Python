No one can say "no" to you, Willow. Well, I'm not sure that that's true, but it has come to my attention that a tin of Christmas cookies can make all of the difference when... asking for a favor. I'm already covering for you while you're gone. What else do you need? I need someone to water my plants. Willow, you've got a lot of plants. I was hoping you hadn't noticed, but I'm gonna be gone for four weeks, and they need a lot of love. It's very exciting that your sister is getting married. You're gonna have a busy holiday. Yes. I think it's gonna be fun. And hopefully it takes my mind off of getting transferred... Again. Every two years, like clockwork. Any idea where they're gonna send you this time? I've heard we invested in a ski resort in Colorado. So that's my best guess. There are worse places to be transferred. - Do you like to ski? - I guess I'll find out. About the plants...? I want more cookies. Two dozen. Deal! [chuckles] - Merry Christmas. - Thank you, Willow. - Bye. - Bye. ♪ ...In the meadow, ♪ ♪ we can build a snowman ♪ ♪ We'll pretend that ♪ ♪ he is Parson Brown ♪ ♪ He'll say, "are you ready?" ♪ ♪ we'll say, "no, man" ♪ ♪ but you can do the job ♪ ♪ while you're in town" ♪ ♪ later on, we'll conspire... ♪ ♪ as we dream by the fire ♪ ♪ to face unafraid ♪ ♪ the plans that we've made ♪ ♪ walking in a winter wonderland... ♪ ♪ Walking in a winter wonderland ♪ ♪ Walking ♪ ♪ in a winter ♪ ♪ wonderland ♪ Juni! Willow! You're here! Of course I'm here! My baby sister is getting married. Yeah, I am. In four weeks, I'm gonna be... - "Mrs. Austin Boyle." - Mhm. "Juni Boyle." Mmmm. "Juni Petersen-hyphen-Boyle." You've been writing this in all your notebooks, haven't you? Of course. Okay, so, wedding duty. Put me to work. Come on. Mom's waiting. - Okay. - Come here. [both giggling] Ah! Mom? - Willow! - Ah! Oh! Look how beautiful you are! You too, Juni. Oh, my goodness. Everybody, look how beautiful my daughter is. This is the best Christmas present ever. You're acting like I haven't seen you in forever. You were just in New York a couple months ago. Well, it's not the same thing as having you home. Always so busy. She manages a big hotel in New York! And before that, it was Chicago and before that, it was... - Phoenix! - Right. And the assistant manager. Meh! You oversee everything. I mean, it's the second-most important job. Manager/assistant manager, tomato/to-mah-to. I'm just so proud of you. Thank you, mom. So, how goes the wedding prep? Snow. I'm gonna need more information than that, mom. Too much of it on the roof of the hall where we were going to get married. They think it's gonna collapse and they say they can't do anything about it until it melts. What? When did this happen? Last week. Well, why didn't you call me? I could've helped. What, with the roof? No, but I could've helped you find another venue. I just... I didn't want to bother you. And we've been looking, but none of the good places are available. Although, we did find a few possibilities that were okay. No. No. My sister's not getting married in somewhere that's just "okay." well, it's better than no place at all. Listen, if you just give me a little bit of time, I'm sure I can find you someplace spectacular. Everyone I talked to said all the spectacular places are taken. [quiet determination]: Well... They say that now. Uh-oh. I know that look. [chuckles] [Juni squeals] [laughter] I'm go glad you're here. Right. Sure. But are you sure that there isn't just a little bit of wiggle room in that schedule? No, I tried there, they're booked solid. Same as the other dozen places that I've called. Well, no, actually, I work at a hotel also, so I do understand. [sighs] okay, well, please call me if anything changes? Great. Thank you. Bye. [♪♪♪] [footsteps] Hey, mom. Hi! You can help me with the nativity scene. We need 24 animals in the barnyard. Okay, listen, I have an idea of where we could have... Why 24? Well, the coffee shop up the street from the cafe has a dozen in their nativity scene and I've always said our diner is twice as good, so... There you go. Okay. It worries me that you went there and counted... Look, I have an idea of where Juni could get married. Where? Eagle ridge inn. Oh... Darling, they don't do weddings. No, david lyndon owns it now, and says there's no room at the inn, so to speak. David lyndon. Isn't that the name... Austin's best man? Yes. They work at the law firm together. David said he wanted to help, but he said there's no space for the ceremony. And he is selling it, so. Oh, he's selling it? Austin said he's got a buyer who's very interested. Hmm. I just wish there was some way of having the wedding there. I mean, it was such a magical place to grow up. It was a wonderful place to raise you kids. We loved owning the inn. And it would make Juni so happy... [sighs, frustrated] Yes, it would. Yes, it would. Grandma, I need more glitter for Mrs. Jackson's Christmas card. It's very sweet that you're making one for a guest. She's a teacher. She helped me with my math homework. Oh. Well, then yes, you definitely need more glitter. [both chuckling] Mm! Good morning, mom. - Good morning, sweetie. - Morning. Where is he? In the reception area with garrett. Great. Wish me luck. Wait! Dad? You haven't found henry yet. I looked everywhere. I give up. Where'd you hide him? I can't tell you that. You have to find him. That's how it works. Right. You forgot where you hid him, didn't you? No! Maybe. But... [sighs] It's still your job to find him. You know what? You're right, it is my job, but it's also my job not to be late for work. Your job is not to be late for school. Okay, but... You'll look for him after work tonight, right? You know what? We are gonna look for him together. [smooch] You need more glitter. Exactly! Okay, you're sure you're okay taking natalie to school? Partners need to be punctual. Prospective partners, mom. All right. Natalie, you have a good day at school. Okay. You have a good day at work. I will. Thanks, sweetie. Go get your backpack, please. - Okay. - All right. And you, go close the deal. Thanks, mom. Okay... [♪♪♪] And the wiring is in great shape. They just replaced it about three years ago. Oh, that's good to hear. Robert. Sorry to keep you waiting. Ten-year-olds are on their own timetable. Say no more. I had a few of those myself a while back. It's the best. Has garrett been giving you all the information you need? Yes, he's been great. So, does the purchase price include the handyman? We'll talk. I'll leave you to it. Okay. Thanks, garrett. [robert sighs] David, I gotta tell you, this is a beautiful place you have here. Oh, thank you very much. It's gonna be tough to say goodbye. Do you host events here? Yeah, we do luncheons, receptions. Wedding receptions? We don't do weddings. We talked about building a chapel, but we just never really got around to it. We? My late wife and I. She had, uh, a lot of plans for this place. I'm sorry. I had no idea. No, no, it's okay. I never asked, but why are you selling? Well, I am about to become partner at my law firm. Hey! Congratulations. Thank you very much. Yeah, but, uh... I'm already too busy to pay as much attention to the inn as it deserves, and with some changes coming up at my job, I'm just gonna have a lot of work to do, so I think it's just... It's time to let it go. - Mm. - But listen. You feel free to look around, and garrett will answer any questions you need. - All right. Thank you, david. - Thank you! - Okay. - All right. [♪♪♪] Whew. Good morning, Mrs. Sachs. How was your walk today? Oh, beautiful, just beautiful. Oh, there's nothing like this blue ridge mountain air. Oh, I know. I only wish I could stay longer. Well, you are always welcome. Oh, I do hope to come back someday. It's special here. Yeah. It is. [♪♪♪] Hello? Oh... Hello. Sorry. Can I help you? I'm looking for david lyndon. In the barn? No, it's about what I would like to do to his barn. [laughs] I'm sorry. But you... Who are you? [laughs] I skipped that part, didn't I? I'm sorry. I'm Willow petersen. - Oh... - I... Actually grew up here. Petersen. Was your father hank? You guys used to own this place, right? Yes, my father built the place. And my sister, Juni... Juni is getting married to austin, who is my best friend. You're Juni's sister, Willow. Okay. It's all coming together now. I get it. Um... I just gotta say, your family did a fantastic job of this place. Thank you, really. It was a great place for a kid to grow up. Yes. Yes, indeed, indeed. Sorry, you were saying you wanted to do something to my barn? Yes, so, speaking of Juni and austin, you heard that they lost their wedding venue. - Right? - Yes. So I was just thinking that they could get married here, at eagle ridge. Right. Yeah, no, actually, we've had that conversation, but unfortunately, there's nowhere to have the ceremony, so. Oh, but there is. The barn? Yeah. I mean, look at this... There's enough space. With the right decor, it would be absolutely gorgeous. I guess you haven't heard I'm actually selling the inn. I did, but it's not sold yet. No, but we do have a prospective buyer who's on the fence right now, but it's looking pretty good. But maybe he could just wait a couple weeks until after Christmas. It's only a few weeks away. Right. Four weeks to organize an entire wedding, get all the stuff, and plus, the inn needs some work. Which I would oversee, bec... Did you know, I actually, I work in hospitality, and I do a lot of events for my company's hotels. And, when you think about it, hosting a wedding here would be kind of like staging it for your sale. - Huh. - Mm. The buyer was asking about weddings. Right? We can show him the possibilities. - We? - Yes! Well, me. I would do all of the work. You wouldn't have to do anything. It's just the cost and the... No, my family's paying for everything that has to do with the wedding. Look, I would absolutely love to help, I mean, I'm austin's best man, but I just, I don't really have any time for this right now. I'm very busy, and I gotta go to work right now. Sure, but maybe... - It was so nice... - But... To meet you, Willow. You too! Or we could talk... [sighs] [words catch] [shouts] do you like cookies? Is this too low? Who wants to get married in a barn? I mean, it's a barn. Yeah, this is too low. Someone's gonna run into this and sue me... It was just so out of the blue, you know? Which would be ironic. Hey. You listening to me? What? I said... Whoa, that's too low. Well, can you help me out then? No, I can't, because I am gonna go dazzle the partners with my brilliant legal mind. Well, how are you gonna do that? Mm, I guess, I'll say "ergo" and "to wit" a lot, 'cause they love that stuff. Shocking you haven't made partner yet. - Mm. - Hey, hey. - Ask about secret santa. - What about it? I sent in a proposal to up the maximum gift price to 30 bucks. Right. How much was that portable putting green you wanted for your office? Um, $29.99. - Exactly. - It's a coincidence. Okay. Listen. You know that I would host the ceremony if I thought I could make it work, right? Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it. - Okay. - We'll figure it out. - We will, right? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. - All right. [sighs] it is too low. We are gonna need a lot more jellybeans. You have enough for that. This is only the beginning. This is the guest house, hon! Oh, I see. The coffee shop down the street has a gingerbread house and yours has to be that much bigger and better? I'm simply showing that brogan's diner is the place to be for the true spirit of Christmas. [laughs] Jun, you're kind of quiet. I'm just thinking about how special it would be to get married at eagle ridge. [sighs] I'm sorry. I shouldn't have even said anything. You know, I tried. He just wouldn't even consider it. Give the guy a break. You know, it must be... It must be tough for him. What, selling the inn? Needing to sell the inn because you can't do it by yourself anymore. Not ever intending to do it by yourself in the first place. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I didn't think about it that way. How did you do it, mom? You went right from the inn to the restaurant, and you raised two kids while doing it. Well... [chuckles] You know what? It's like a house. You have a solid foundation, you can make it whatever you want. Your dad and I made... A pretty solid foundation. [♪♪♪] Mwah... Mwah. - I love you. - I love you. [♪♪♪] Hey, sweetie. Henry wasn't in the kitchen either. But dad... I know, I know, but we've looked everywhere. He's gonna turn up eventually, I promise. In the meantime, you've got all your stuffed animals right here. But henry's my favorite. Mom gave him to me. I know. And since this is our last Christmas at the inn, I'll need henry more than ever. Right. So, we're gonna keep looking for him tomorrow, and we'll find him, I promise. I still don't understand why we have to move. [sighing softly] Well... It's like I've said. My job's about to become a lot bigger, and I'm not gonna have as much time to devote to the inn. But grandma helps. And garrett, too. And I can do more. Hey. Remember last year, when we donated some of your toys to the church? Yeah, they were ones I didn't have time to play with anymore. Right. But there are kids out there that do have time to play with toys, and toys do need someone to play with them, right? Right. Well, that's kind of like the inn. You know? It needs someone to pay attention to it in ways that I can't anymore. Someone who can... Love it, care for it, like we have. That's a lot of love. That is a lot of love. I'm gonna miss it here. Yeah. Me too. [chuckles softly] Hey. Get some sleep. [laughs] Goodnight, dad. Goodnight, sweetie. Mwah! All right. [♪♪♪] [laughing] Well, thanks for picking up the tab for lunch, dad. Oh, happy to. You take us out all the time. - Willow. - Willow? Hi. Yeah, hey. - Hello. - Hey. Uh, mom, dad, this is Juni's sister. - You're Willow! - Yes. Linda talks about you all the time at the diner. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, don't be silly. Being proud of our kids is part of our job. Like this one is about to become partner at his law firm. Yes, I heard. Congratulations. Thank you, but, again, I'm not partner yet, and it's definitely not gonna happen if I take lunches this long, so I should get back to work. But it was great to see you, Willow. Actually, would you mind if I walked with you a little ways? No. Great. Nice to meet you. See you, guys. - You too, Willow. - Bye now. So, uh... About the wedding. I do think that putting on one big event before you leave could help you sell it, though. I mean, really, Christmas used to be spectacular at eagle ridge. We would go all out with lights and decorations. We used to have carriage rides. Wow. Carriage rides? Yes, you know, like a hay ride, but without the snow. It was the closest thing that people could get to a sleigh ride. They used to love it. What I mean is, don't you want one last spectacular Christmas there, before you leave? I mean, I know that natalie would, but I just, I gotta tell you, I just don't have the time to do anything. Oh, I-I would do everything. Everything. I would do Christmas, I would do the wedding. I could even bring in a team to do any repairs that you could need. I've actually got a repairman, garrett, he could actually take care of all that. Why is this so important to you? My family built eagle ridge. It's Juni's big day. It's just very important to us. I wouldn't have to do anything? I would do absolutely all of the work. You wouldn't even know that we are there. And david... You would be making a lot of Christmas wishes come true. I don't want to go too crazy. Is that a yes? To Christmas wishes... To Christmas wishes. [♪♪♪] Okay, now, since the reception will be spilling out into this room, I think it needs some attention. What are you thinking? Well, the floors could use a good polish and I think we need a new coat of paint. Sorry. You're... Painting? Of course. Oh. I just kind of thought you were tidying up. I mean, this room doesn't even need to be painted, does it? We're just sprucing it up a little bit. I'd keep it simple, I promise. Let me show you some swatches. Oh, you know what, I just came home for lunch. Five minutes, I promise. Stop encouraging her. - So... - Okay. Oh, hi! I was hoping I was gonna run into you before I left. I literally just walked in the door. Oh, but I need to talk to you about something important. Christmas decorations. I think we have plenty already. Do we need more? I think we need to talk about adding more lights. How many more? Well, probably a strand or two. Five at the most. We also need to re-open the discussion about paint. Paint? But I... So, here's what I'm thinking. We put the altar down here. Okay, no, that's great. Austin and I will be there in 30 minutes, max. 45 minutes, max. Okay, can you just go ahead and read it to me? So do you really think you can make this place look good in time? Oh, yeah, I mean, it's mainly cosmetic. It'll be a snap. Great. So you won't mind if we add a few things? Oh, like what? The wedding's two days before Christmas, so we want trees. Trees, plural? Yes. Like, eight or nine of them. Yeah, and lots of decorations. Yes, and garlands and wreaths and bows, the whole nine yards. Wait, I... Hold on one sec? I... [stammers] One tree is plenty. Did... [footsteps] [dejected sigh] Hi. Did you lose something? Uh, well, sort of. I hid something and now I can't find it. Oh, uh, what is it? Henry. Who's henry? My reindeer. Oh. He's my best friend. Well, except for rona, she's like my best real friend, but henry is like my best toy friend. Right, and now you don't know where he is? Dad and I play hide-and-seek with him. It was my turn to hide him, and I found a really good spot, but... Now I don't remember where it was. Okay, well, why don't you just tell me what he looks like, and I will keep an eye out for him. Okay, well, he's a reindeer... Right. About this big... Natalie, I took a look again upstairs, but I couldn't... oh. Hi. Hi. I didn't know you were still here. Well, I was on my way out, but then I ran into who I presume is natalie? Yes, of course, natalie, this is Willow. She's the one I was telling you about, who's doing all the work around the inn. You're the Christmas lady! The what? You're the Christmas lady. Dad said you're doing all sorts of Christmas stuff around the inn. It's making him crazy. [laughs, horrified] Crazy... Excited. Is it true we're gonna have a million Christmas trees? Is it? Uh, no. No. Not a million, but there will be a lot. I'm actually going to the Christmas tree lot tonight. Oh, dad! Can we go? I want to pick out a tree for us, too. You know what? We are going on the weekend. But dad... If Willow gets hers tonight and we get ours later, they won't match. But they're all the same, aren't they? No, each tree is unique and special in its own way. Yeah, dad. I mean... Once you put on the lights and decorations, you won't even be able to tell the difference. I will. Please, dad? [sighs grudgingly] Okay, I guess we're going tree-shopping tonight. Yay! - Thank you, dad! - [laughing] you're welcome. - I'll go get my coat! - Okay. [natalie giggling] [♪♪♪] Ooh... This one. And this one! This one. Ooh! This one's pretty, too. You've liked every tree in the lot. That's because all of them have been pretty great so far. Yes. I'm gonna go look at the trees over there. I'll tell you if I find any good ones. [Willow laughs] Has she always been, uh, this enthusiastic? Yeah. It's... A lot sometimes. I was actually the exact same way when I was little. Everything had to be turned up to 11, especially at Christmas. So, not a lot has changed? Look, I thought we agreed, I just want to put on a beautiful wedding and have an excellent Christmas. And I thought we agreed that that's what was best for everybody. Right, no, I was just wondering when we're gonna get to the part where I don't have to worry about anything? Tomorrow. Friday at the latest. I'm serious, Willow. I can't keep getting pulled away from work to give your sister her dream wedding... Which apparently involves every Christmas tree in existence, for some reason. It's not just about the wedding. It's about getting your buyer off the fence and putting on a spectacular event that shows off what a magical place eagle ridge really is. I hear you, and I appreciate that, I really do, but the reason I'm selling the inn is because I need to focus on becoming partner, and that has to come first. Look, all I'm saying is you said you were gonna take care of everything, and that hasn't been the case. You know what? You're right. As of right now, you're off the hook. Thank you. - Dad! - Hey. Come on, I need to show you all the trees I picked out. Tomorrow. Friday at the latest. Sure. No, the payroll company does all that. Yeah, you just have to approve the time sheets. Thanks, tasha. Bye. - I'm sorry... - [robert gasps] oh! - [robert laughing] - I'm so sorry! I just didn't want to get in your picture. Sorry, I was just daydreaming, I guess. That's okay. I just hope it was a good dream. It might be. In fact, I was just imagining what this place might look like with more Christmas decorations. I'm thinking about buying the place. Oh! Please, allow me. Picture this. Sparking lights... On the roof, around the windows, the eaves, garlands with bows, of course, every five feet. More wreaths, and here, on the rocks, light-up snowmen. [laughs] you've really thought this out. I actually grew up here. My family used to own eagle ridge. Really? Yeah. What was it like growing up here? I was just so lucky. You know? Anyway, do you have children? Two daughters, but they're grown. Grand kids or...? Mm. Not yet. Right, well, when you do, they're gonna love it here. Hmm. I wish I could've seen this place the way it used to be. Anyway, I'm so sorry for being in the way. Not at all. Stop, you're not. - Robert. - Willow. - Nice to meet you. - And you. [both] take care. [♪♪♪] All right, so you got the file for the harrison merger? Yeah, yeah, I got it right here. [grumbles] aw. What? What's wrong? Willow needs me at the inn, again. Okay, well, don't worry about it. I can cover this. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm good. Go. All right. Thank you. Go get 'em. So, everything's on track? Yes, it is. Okay, because you do know that Christmas and the wedding are in three weeks. Three and a half, more or less. Okay, at the hotel, where I work with spreadsheets, there's no such thing as "more or less" in a spreadsheet, so... Well, before I worked here, I was a contractor, and we specialize in "more or less." okay. Don't worry. Everything will get done. It's like Christmas. You just gotta believe. Willow, what's up? I got your text. - Hey. Okay. - Hey. Tell me what you see. Is this a trick question? No. Just look at the inn and tell me... Willow, I don't have time for this. Okay, fine, I will tell you what I see. Okay. We need more Christmas. I think we have plenty of Christmas. Nope. Not according to your prospective buyer, robert? I ran into him, right here, and he was just saying that he wishes he could see the inn done up, full Christmas spectacular. And you think that'll convince him to buy it? I think that he needs a reason to believe that the inn is special, and he just hasn't found one yet. But, I mean, lights and garland are temporary. He can do whatever he wants with the inn when he owns it. Look, for whatever reason, he's having a hard time picturing it. He needs to see it, not just hear about it. Okay. What do you have in mind? Okay. I didn't realize how much I missed it here. So you don't ever come home for Christmas? I just usually only get a day or two off. Between family and friends, I haven't been making it down. [sighing] I just love it. Do you like it? It's really nice. It is a little bit sad, though, that you have to sell the inn in order to be partner. Well, I've been working toward it since law school. It's actually nice to finally get back on track. How so? I had a plan. You know? Law school, pass the bar, get married, have a kid, and make partner. But, sadly, things got derailed when my wife died a few years ago. Right. I'm sorry. What was her name? Shelly. The inn was really her passion. I mean, don't get me wrong, natalie and I love it there, too, but it's just... Time to move on. How did you deal with it when you guys had to sell the inn? Not very well. I was 15. It was right after my dad passed and... Yeah, finding out we needed to sell eagle ridge it was... It was another huge loss. I'm sorry, too. I think it's part of why I do what I do, that I wanted to be in the hotel industry. I wanted to recapture some of what I experienced as a kid, you know, share that with people. Have you? I try... But it's different. Yeah. I get transferred around a lot, I never truly feel settled anywhere. But I think that maybe when I'm managing my own property, it'll be different, it'll feel more fulfilling somehow. Ah, someday, right? Why not today? 'Cause today is scary. Hey. What about that wreath there, for the barn door? We'll take it. Oh, I got it. That's the spirit! It's so cold out. Wow! Put on your gloves. It's freezing. Wow! [all chuckling] Well, what do you think? I love it. But I think we need to give the snowmen names. I think so, too. Did you have anything in mind? Hmm... Prancer, comet, donner, and blitzen. Those are reindeer names. They can be snowmen names, too. That's a good point. Don't they light up? Yes, they do. We are just waiting for garrett to put the finishing touches on the lights, then we'll turn 'em on. Is this what Christmas was like when you were a kid here, Willow? Why, yes, it was actually a lot like this. The whole family would get together and decorate. We'd sing Christmas carols, we'd drink hot chocolate. It was... Mm. Hot cocoa. I've got some made. Oh! Good. Let's go get it. Do you miss it? Having Christmas at the inn? Well, yes, sometimes, but, you know, I also, um, kind of miss it in a good way. You know? My dad always used to say that memories are the things that we use to wrap ourselves up in to keep us warm at night. And it's true. Even today, no matter where I am... I always feel warm thinking about all the special nights I spent here. Just like this one? Well, yeah, just like this one. [♪♪♪] Hot chocolate. Oh. Oh, great! Okay. I think we're ready. Now, I patched everything into a remote control, so all you have to do is hit the button. Oh, great. Thanks, garrett. All right. Natalie, want to do the honors? Ooh. Yes, please. Ready? This button here. Three... Two... One. [♪♪♪] - [all gushing] - beautiful! Wow! Okay, wait, wait, wait. There's more, there's more. Turn around. Ready? And... Now. [♪♪♪] [overlapping] oh! Now, that's what I call Christmas. [♪♪♪] It's looking pretty good in here. Yeah. I mean, there's still a lot to do, but I think we've made remarkable progress in a week. How many trees did you get? Santa's village is gonna be jealous. Hey, can you switch out those electrical outlets I showed you? - Yeah. Sure. - Great. Do you want to write it down? I got it. Garrett, we have a lot to do and not a lot of time to do it. Three weeks. More or less. Right. I... [muttering] henry...? Where are you, henry? Oh. Hey, mark. What's going on? Oh, the hunt for henry continues. Yes, natalie's reindeer. I heard. So no sightings, then? Afraid not. David's looking in the basement and I think natalie is upstairs, searching the utility room. Well, I'm sure it'll turn up. [mark sighs] Any luck? I found this old winter coat I lost three years ago, but... No henry. Natalie's gonna be heartbroken if we don't find it. I know, I feel like we've looked everywhere twice. I wish we could do something to take her mind off of it. Willow, is there anything that she can do for you? Why, yes, actually. Mrs. Hill from the stables is gonna be here any minute with a horse and carriage. Horse and carriage? Yes, it's for the wedding. It's gonna bring Juni from the inn down to the barn. Didn't you used to have carriages here at Christmas? Yes! That was so much fun. David, you have to bring them back. We already have every last bit of Christmas on the outside of the inn, dad. Do we really need carriage rides? Nobody needs carriage rides, but it's fun, and everybody needs fun, especially at Christmas time. You should listen to your father, david. He's a wise man. He is very wise, but he's not paying for it. Well, it's part of the wedding, so my family's paying for it. Okay, I mean... A horse would take her mind off of this. What am I saying? A horse would take her mind off of everything. Perfect. And you should come with us. And do not tell me that you have to work. It's Saturday. You know, you're right. You're right! I'll go get natalie. - [smack] - [mark laughs] Oh, this is perfect. Your buyer's gonna take one look at this, and the inn, and he's just gonna whip out his checkbook on the spot. I don't know about that. Dad. I'm petting the horse! I see that. And his name is frosty, like the snowman. Oh, that's a great name. And Mrs. Hill, she said we can go for a ride. - Oh. - Oh. Actually, I don't know if we have time to do that, sweetie. But dad, the carriage is right here, and frosty's all ready to go. I think he wants to give us a ride. [giggles] Well, I mean, if frosty wants to... Well, how can we say "no" to frosty? Yay! [natalie laughing] She's really having fun. Yes, she is, and I have you to thank for that, so... Thank you. Well, gotta say, it hasn't been easy. The guy who owns the inn has been pretty resistant to everything I wanted to do. [laughs] Listen. We do celebrate, you know. We do lights, the presents, and everything, it's just that we haven't done a really big Christmas in a few years. I-I know that you haven't, and I understand why, and I hope you don't think that I don't... No, no, no. It's okay, it's okay. In fact, it's more than okay. It's time we did a really big Christmas. [♪♪♪] So, um, what was your absolute favorite Christmas? Oh... Wow. Uh... Okay. Well, the one that's popping into my mind has got to be when I was six years old. I remember I had gotten it into my head that I was gonna stay up all night so I could meet santa when he came to bring the presents because I just wanted to thank him. You know? For all the gifts he had brought me in the past, and I just wanted to see him eat a Christmas cookie. Makes sense. How late did you stay up? I was asleep by 9:45. Okay. It was a good Christmas. How about you? Um... Well, probably the Christmas when I was 14. Yeah. Well, we didn't know it was gonna be our last one here with my dad, but it was. I just remember it because he was so happy. You know? Christmas was just his favorite time of the year, and we had a bunch of friends and family come and stay with us... Yeah. He just... he knew how to make it really special for us, you know? That's nice. Hey, natalie? What do you say we do carriage rides at the inn this Christmas? Yay! Did you hear that frosty? [giggling] Come on! We need to take a picture. Oh, I'll take it. You have to be in it. Yeah, no, you need to be in it. I don't mind. No, no. You know what? You do have to be in it. She's right. Sorry, Mrs. Hill, do you mind taking a photo of us? Thank you. Three... Two... One... Carrots! [laughing] - Hey. - Hi. I'm heading home. Okay. Thank you for everything. Where's natalie? She's in the bath. She was very excited about that horse. Yeah. I have a feeling she's gonna want to update her Christmas list. I have a feeling you're right. Sounds like you all had a good time, though. Yeah, we did. I mean, Willow sure knows how to do Christmas. Yes, she does. She's such a sweetheart. Yeah. [♪♪♪] [footsteps] [gasps] oh. [both chuckling] I am going to look spectacular arriving at my wedding in that carriage. Yes. Yes, you are. And it's one more thing to cross off my wedding to-do list. I'm sorry, what? You had a horse and carriage on your wedding to-do list? [embarrassed chuckle] It's a very long list that I was never going to get through, so let's just pretend it was, okay? Sure. Wedding planning is fun. Oh, yeah. I'm not stressed out at all. Right. I'm glad that you're getting the two of them out to have fun. Austin has been so worried that david was spending too much time working. Well, he's probably right, but I'm trying. And you're doing a great job... On the inn, the wedding, Christmas... Everything. Have I told you how much I appreciate it? Several times, yes. But, really, I'm... I'm enjoying it. I'm glad. But...? I just want to make sure that you're not getting too emotionally invested. No. Why would you, uh, why would you say that? I just... I know how much the inn means to you. Right, the inn. Yeah, and I remember how hard it was for us to leave it when we were kids. Mm-hmm. I don't want you to feel badly when Christmas is over and you have to go back to New York. You're leaving a lot behind. Don't worry, Juni. I'll be careful. Thank you, Juni. Of course. Take care of yourself. Will do. - Love you. - Love you. See you tonight at the tree lighting. Where are dad and grandpa? Grandpa had a quick errand to run, and your dad got held up at work, but they are on their way. They're gonna miss the tree. I'm sure they're gonna make it on time. Don't you worry. Why don't I get us some hot apple cider to keep us warm? - Yeah! - I'll help. Willow, will you stay here with natalie? - Yes, of course. - Thank you. So... Are you excited for the lights? Yeah. But it's gonna have to be pretty special to be better than what we have at the inn. Mm... I don't know, I think they're gonna top us. [natalie giggles] You know, lighting the tree is kind of the town's way of saying it's officially Christmas. Well, I think it should be Christmas all the time. Really? See, I kind of think that having Christmas only once a year is kind of what makes it special. - Really? - Mm-hmm. How so? Well, think about all of the things that you look forward to at Christmastime. The carols, the decorations... And the cookies. Yes, exactly, the cookies. You wait all year, and you think about having that Christmas cookie, and then when you finally get one, it's so delicious, right? It's like all that waiting has finally paid off. Yes, exactly. It's like it's a reward. Because, if you had Christmas cookies every day of every week of the year, it just it wouldn't feel as special. Hmm. I haven't thought of it that way. [sighs] okay. Now I really want to bake Christmas cookies. Me too! [deep breath] hmm. So, tell me, what else about Christmas do you think is worth waiting for? Hmm... Everything. [laughs] We have dinner at my grandma's, and then we call my other grandparents, my grandma and grandpa, on the computer, and we always have Christmas morning at the inn. I mean... [sighs] I guess we won't have that anymore after this year. Well, that's okay. It doesn't really matter where you are, it only matters that you're with the people that you love. [♪♪♪] Ah, there's Juni and austin. Let's go say hi. - Yeah. - Okay. Hey! - Hey! - Hey. Hey, it's almost time to light the tree. Let's do it. Yeah. So the tie was the errand, huh? I have chosen to believe that your mother finds this kind of thing charming. Well, you've been married 40-something years, so it's gotta be doing something right. Takes practice. And patience. A lot of patience. I remember. So you're gonna have a full house at the inn soon. Yeah, I mean, we have austin's family staying over the holidays. Juni's friends are gonna be there. That should be the most people we've had there in a long time. You know, you could've had that place full all the time, if you just did a little more advertising. It's like you were trying to keep it secret. No, it's like I was too busy, dad. Too busy? That all it was? I just... I didn't really know how to do it by myself. And I got to admit, seeing the inn come back to life has been great, but I know I have to move on. Well, you did an amazing job with it. It's mostly Willow. Gonna find it tough to say goodbye? Oh, to the inn? Yeah, no, it'll be tough. Well, it's never too late to change your mind. Dad! You made it! [david laughs] I wouldn't miss it, kiddo. Grandpa, your tie. Grandma, isn't it great? I think it's absolutely... Charming. Welcome, everyone. It's time to light the tree! Is everybody ready? Please welcome our special... Okay, the button's over there. You go push it! Natalie! [crowd] ...Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Wow! Merry Christmas, everyone! [crowd cheering] Merry Christmas! [♪♪♪] Cheers. All right, kiddo. Bedtime. But maybe a bedtime story first? We just read three. [sighs] but... Just one more? A short one, a Christmas one. [david sighs] Hey. I found my notebook. It was in the kitchen. Oh, great. Goodnight. Goodnight, you two. Oh! Willow can read me a bedtime story. Um... Well, I... Okay with me, if it's okay with Willow. Yeah, of course, it's okay. Lucky! [giggles] All right... What have we here? Oh. Oh, well, here's one. All right. Let's see here. Okay. A visit from st. Nicholas. You know, my dad used to read this to me and my sister, Juni, all the time. This and a Christmas carol. Ooh! Dad says I get to read a Christmas carol next year. Mm, and that will definitely be something to look forward to. Mm-hmm. "'Twas the night before Christmas," when all through the house, "not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse." well, that's good, because we definitely don't want mice in the inn. No, we do not. "The stockings were hung by the chimney with care," in hopes that st. Nicholas soon would be there. The children were nestled all snug in their beds, "while visions of sugarplums danced in their heads." [door shuts] All right. She finally fell asleep. Oh, thank you. You know, she doesn't let just anyone read her a bedtime story. Oh, well, in that case, I'm especially honored. And I appreciate it. Also, thank you for suggesting we go to the tree lighting tonight. It was a lot of fun. It really was. Yeah. So... Two weeks to go. Are we gonna make it? Uh, I think so. I hope so. Wait. Ms. Don't-worry-about-anything only "hopes" so? Okay, now I'm gonna worry about everything. Well, then, see? We'll balance each other out. Maybe so. Mm. Hey, look. I have to admit that this is shaping up to be a rather spectacular Christmas, and I know that I was kind of hesitant. - A little. - Yeah. But it's really working out well, and I just want to say that I've really enjoyed spending so much time with you. Working on the inn. You too. The inn. - The inn, yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, I hope that your buyer is impressed and that, uh, you can just sell it quickly and just move right along. Right, yeah, and you can... Get back to your regular life. Anyway... - Oh, I'll get your jacket. - Oh, thank you. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Yeah. - There we go. So, uh, I'm just curious. Like, if you didn't come back here for Christmas, what would you have been doing? Oh, well, first of all, I probably would've come in the night before Christmas and left the day right after Christmas. I never get to spend this much time here, but, um... I am really glad that I did. You ever think about moving back? I'd consider it, you know, if the right reason popped up. What would be the right reason? I think I'd know it when I see it. Right. Anyway, it's late, I should... Okay. Goodnight. - Bye. - Bye. Welcome, everyone! Hello! Welcome to brogan's diner and our annual holiday celebration. [cheering] [applauding] We really do appreciate each of you so much. Now, who's ready to play some Christmas games? [cheering] Christmas games? She takes Christmas very seriously. Now I see where you get it from. Inside these boxes are Christmas bells. Teams of two will try to be the first ones to unwrap the box and ring the bell. The catch is... Your hands are gonna be tied together, and the other hand has to be behind your back. No cheating. The first team to unwrap the box and ring the bell wins... Free pie for a week. Okay? Everybody, assemble your teams. Nat, you wanna be partners? - Of course. - Yes! [natalie giggles] Hmm. Willow, david... You're a team. - Oh! - We... We are? Okay, um, I don't remember raising my hand. My game, my rules. - I guess we should... - Yes. [♪♪♪] All right... Hands, please? Um... - Yes. - Okay. Like that. - This is so much fun! - Are you ready? Other hand behind our backs, is that right? - Yes, please. - Okay. - Ready? - Ready. Set? Go-ho-ho! [laughter] [♪♪♪] There, we got that part off. Here we go! Ribbon off! Grab the... grab the corner. You gotta try. I am trying! You gotta pull on... What? Oh... It's a lot more difficult than it seems... [jingling] [all cheering] Yay! Natalie and austin win! Oh, thank you so much! [shouting] pi-I-I-ie! [laughter] [whinnying] Look at this place! I know. Can you imagine how beautiful it would look if you had just let me paint? [laughs] I just love seeing it like this. Full of life and energy. It just reminds me of when we first bought it. David? Are you sure about selling the inn? I am. I mean, I see it like this, and it's tempting, you know? To just chuck the nine-to-five and the suit, and go run an inn. But... I didn't work as hard as I worked to become partner just to give up when I'm so close to it. You know? Right. What did you call it? Um... "getting back on track." that's right. That's... Something like that, yeah. Still, though, it's a... It's a nice dream, isn't it? It is. Hey, david! Yeah? Um, best man duty calls. Right. [♪♪♪] [indistinct conversations] [Willow] pink icing... Is that all right? Pink is good. Yeah. You really should put more sprinkles on that one. Oh, I think maybe you need more sprinkles! [laughing] What's going on here? We're making Christmas cookies. Yeah, I see that, and they smell wonderful. Well, let me get you one, then. Oh, please. I found natalie out in the barn looking for henry, so I thought maybe we should take a little Christmas spirit break. [quietly] thank you. Oh! Thank you. Oh, sorry. Mm. This is delicious. Totally worth the wait. Right, Willow? Oh, yeah. So, natalie did you wish for anything special this year from santa? I did. But I can't tell you or it won't come true. Oh. It didn't have to do with a certain horse named frosty, did it? No. Willow explained to me that frosty needs to stay with Mrs. Hill. [mouths words] So, what did you wish for? Me? Um... Uh... Well, like you said, if I tell you, then it won't come true. Not even a hint? I'll tell you what. I will trade you one cookie for one hint. These cookies are really good. They're worth at least two hints. - Mm-hmm. - Really? Well, then, maybe I'll just... Tickle you! [laughing loudly] Oh, I'm going to steal it. [laughing and squealing] Thanks for the ride. Oh... Robert? - Hey. - I didn't know you were here. Oh, no, I didn't want to bother you, I just wanted to look around a little bit on my own. I love what you've done here. I mean, the carriage rides? A very nice touch. Oh, thanks, yeah, it's turning out great. But, listen, the wedding's not for another week, so it's not quite finished. You're coming to that, right? 'Cause I want you to see the inn in action with a big event. Sure, I'll be there, but, uh... You know, I really don't need to. I'm ready. Good! Ready...? - To buy the inn? - Yes! [Laughs] First thing Monday, I'm gonna have my realtor call yours. We're gonna make you an offer. That's terrific! I-I... I don't even know what to say. Well, you can start by saying where you got that Christmas cookie. It smells delicious. They're in the kitchen. You go help yourself. I'll be right there. I'm... Oh, wait! Hey! Let's just keep this news between you and I for now, until it's a done deal, okay? No problem. - Terrific! - All right. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] You still haven't told anybody else? Well, I haven't seen the offer. I still don't know if I'm gonna accept it. Why wouldn't you accept it? Are you having second thoughts? No, I'm just having... New thoughts. I don't understand. Neither do I, really. All I know is that I'm starting to realize that the inn is maybe a little more important than I thought. Is this about Willow? No. [chuckles] I'm a mother, I pay attention. It's complicated. That doesn't answer my question. What do you want, david? It's not about Willow or me or what either of us wants. It's not about selling the inn or making partner. I have a little girl who is counting on me and the decision I make is gonna affect her entire life. So... As long as you're not putting any pressure on yourself. [both chuckling] You're a wonderful father, david. When you need to make the decision, you'll know what to do. Thanks, mom. Come on. No, no, no. It's no problem. Truly, call any time. Thank you for you holding down the fort. Merry Christmas. Problems? Just work stuff. You're supposed to be on vacation. I think that they are regretting letting me leave for quite this long. Of course they are. You're so good at handling things. Your job, your sister's wedding, the inn. That's different. It's a labor of love. Oh, you don't love your job? Well, I do. It's different. This is all for Juni. And the-the inn is just special, you know? I will agree with you there. And I think whoever buys the place is gonna be very lucky that you were there. And the right savvy investor could really make a real go of it. I agree. Someone with a background in hotel management, so they really knew what they're doing. Someone emotionally invested in the place... Way to be subtle, mom. It's a week away from Christmas. I don't have time to be subtle. I think you should buy the inn. Mom, I cannot afford it. And besides, being an assistant manager of a hotel does not make me qualify me to run my own business. Really? What have you been doing for the last three weeks? Well, I've been making to-do lists and schedules. I've been pointing at things people need to do, and I'm worrying that they're not going to get done in time. Mm-hmm, that's what running your business is all about. I could open up my retirement account. No, absolutely not. I can't let you do that. And besides, what if I... What if I tried and I failed? Oh. I mean, really, what if it didn't work? I mean, it was dad's dream, and... I just couldn't say goodbye twice, you know? [sighing] [♪♪♪] Tasha, hey, it's me. I'm good, thanks. How are you? Great. Hey, listen. Could I ask you a favor, please? Would you mind sending me the information for the last ten hotels that the company's invested in? Yes. Okay, that's perfect. Thank you. [♪♪♪] Hey. What's all this? Okay, picture this. The horse-drawn carriage with Juni in it pulls up here, comes to a stop. She gets out, she comes up this path, and as she does... Whoa! That's amazing! [Willow laughing] You did all this? Well, garrett did it, but it was my idea. Well, it's a great idea. I can't wait for natalie to see this. She's gonna love it. So, david, have you, uh... Talked anymore to that guy who was interested making an offer on the inn? Yeah, yeah. We've, uh, we've been in touch. Oh. Okay. So, um... The last three weeks have... They've meant a lot to me. Being able to be here, fix up the place, I... It's like I've gotten back a piece of my past, if that makes any sense? That makes total sense. In fact, I feel the same way. - Really? - Yeah. It's like I was waiting for a sign, and seeing this place like this was it. I'm so glad you said that. Because it's telling me that eagle ridge has been around before either of us, it's going to be here long after we're gone, and it's not really about who owns it, it's-it's about the memories we made here, and bringing the inn back to life has given me that closure... So that I can move on. That's great, david. I am very happy for you. I owe it all to you. Thank you. Well, it's getting late. I should go. Right. 'Night. Goodnight. [♪♪♪] What's wrong? What makes you think something is wrong? You're eating fruitcake out of a pan. It's good fruitcake. No, it's not. Why are you eating it? [laughing] because... I need some comfort food. I'm getting married in a week. I need comfort. You look like you could use some fruitcake. I don't like fruitcake. Talk to me. All right, listen. Don't tell anyone, but I... I kind of put together a proposal about my company maybe investing in eagle ridge. Investing? - Yeah. - Why? Well, I'd thought that david didn't really want to sell it at all, that he was only letting it go because he was too busy, and I thought, this way, if my company put in the money, then maybe... I could run it. That would be amazing. Would your company do that? I don't know, and truthfully, it doesn't matter, because david wants to be done with the inn. He just needs closure. Oh. I guess that's kind of understandable, right? It's completely understandable. I mean, the inn represents his past, and he's ready to move on. Maybe you could buy it. Juni, I cannot afford it. Take out a loan! Unless... You don't want to do it without david? I can admit that part of what's made this so fun has been doing all of this with him... And natalie. Of course. Sounds like your feelings for the inn are getting all mixed up with your feelings for david. I only met him a couple weeks ago. I can't have feelings about him. Why not? Because... [sighs] because it's just complicated. Because I might be a person who's pretty good at solving problems, but I do not have a solution for this one. Well, maybe your answer is accepting how you really feel. Yes, the tree! This way. Over there. [♪♪♪] All right! We're getting close! Looking good, guys. [indistinct conversations] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER *** [knocking at door] Come in. Are you okay? Mom said you needed me. I'm getting married in a few hours. Yes, you are. It's okay. Everything's gonna be just fine. How? I have an idea. [chuckles] sorry. We're all out of fruitcake. This is so much better. You're the best. Thanks. Mm. [clink] Merry wedding day. [laughing] hey. Thank you. Everything's good? Everything is great. Yeah. I mean, it's almost Christmas, and I'm getting married today. No last-minute jitters? Not a one. Well, well, maybe one or two, but that's only 'cause I hate wearing tuxedos. I don't know how you do it. I don't know how you stay so calm. Well, I had a good role model. Ugh, none of this "david is wise" stuff. No. No, no, no, that was me goofing around, but, this time, I'm serious. David, I know I joke around a lot, but it's true, you are, like... Like the wiser, much older brother I never had. I'm not that much older than you. Seriously, man, look at everything you've done. With the inn... Raising natalie on your own... You're about to make partner. How you do that all at once, it's... It's amazing. Thank you. Seriously, I mean, sometimes, it just feels like I'm being pulled along for the ride, you know? Ah, everybody feels like that every now and then, but you're gonna figure it out. You always do. It's like... like the work that you did here with Willow. You saw an opportunity to make this place more attractive to the guy who wants to buy it, and it's looking good, right? Yeah, it's looking great. You see? It's all coming together. [unconvincingly] yeah. Unless... There's a part that isn't. No! It's great. Okay. Okay. Well, hey, whatever it is, you're gonna figure it out. If you think so? Yeah, yeah, I didn't make you my best man for nothing. [laughs] all right? Can't believe you're getting married! Yeah. I can't believe it either. [Juni sighs] I still think you should tell david about your proposal. It's not that easy. It should be. Just... Tell him what you want. What if I'm not sure what I want? What if it doesn't even matter what I want? Of course, it matters what you want. And... You're always sure. Remember, when we were kids, and we used to sit around the Christmas tree and dad would ask us which gift we wanted to open first? Mm-hmm. You could never decide. [both laugh] Because, I didn't want my first present to be... Something special, not something like socks. You knew, you always knew, where the good ones were. Mm, not this time. Right now, everything looks like socks. [Juni chuckles] So... What are you gonna do? You have to open something. Do I? I mean, can't I just be here with you and eat some cookies? You could, except... I kind of have to start getting ready. I'm getting married today. Mm-hmm. Yeah, you are. [both chuckling] Mm. [♪♪♪] Finished. I know... We cut it a little close. You got it done in time before the wedding, that's all that matters. Can I see it? It's all yours. You're not gonna come in? No. I know my crew and me did a lot of the work, but... This was your vision. I think you should do it on your own. Thank you, garrett. For everything. [Willow sighs deeply] [♪♪♪] Willow, this is... I know, right? I-I don't even know what to say. I mean... [chuckles] Actually, you know what? I do know what to say. Your father would be very proud of you. Thank you. You're welcome. David, we need to talk. I know. Why is it so hard to know what to say to you? I was just thinking that. [chuckles] I think that we should just try being honest with each other. You heard that I got the offer for the inn? An offer? Yeah. Uh, robert? Right? He said it was the carriage rides that put him over. Told you. [chuckles] yeah... Are you gonna take it? I think I have to, you know? Right. The closure. Mm-hmm. You know, I just... I've... I have felt stuck these last three years and... Like I'm waist-deep in snow and I just can't get out. And if you sell the inn, you get... Unstuck, and...? Yeah, something like that. I have you to thank for it, so... - You're making a huge mistake. - What? I don't think you should sell the inn. What are you talking about? You love it here, david! I can see it in your eyes every time you look around. That doesn't mean that I shouldn't sell it. Yes. Yes, that's exactly what it means. You should always stay and fight for what you love. I know you think that this place represents your past, but I... I think it's your future. What kind of future can I have here? Every time I look around, all I see are these... These memories. That's not a bad thing. You don't have to let go of your memories in order to make new ones. There's always... There's room in our hearts for more. I don't think I can. You don't want to try? I'm sorry. I just have to, um... Get ready for the wedding. [♪♪♪] [hooves clopping] [♪♪♪] [gasps] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [doors rumbling] [♪♪♪] You may be seated. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join this man and woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. So glad to see so many friends and family on this momentous occasion. [laughter] [applauding] To a job well done. Oh. - [clink] - thank you. I knew from the moment I met you you were a person who was good at taking care of things. Well... I'm just glad it all worked out. So, what's next for you? What big job are you going to tackle? Well, I'll go back to New York and then I might be getting transferred to denver. Is that what you want? No. Well, for heaven's sakes, why are you doing it? Because I... Don't have a choice. Willow. You always have a choice. I've never seen david so engaged, so passionate, so happy as he's been the last few weeks... In a long time. Right, but david wants to let go of his past, so... The past isn't something you let go of. It's something you learn from, to build a future from. I think that's what you really want. Well, you don't always get what you want. If my son is as smart as I think he is... You will. [glasses clink] [indistinct background conversations] [♪♪♪] [natalie sighs] There you are. What's going on, kiddo? - Nothing. - Are you... Are you not having a good time? No, I did. The wedding was really pretty. It was, wasn't it? Was that what you and mom's wedding was like? Well, not really, 'cause we got married in a church, not a barn, and ours didn't take place at Christmas, so we didn't have all these beautiful decorations. But it was still fun? Yes. It was... Wonderful. It was a great way to start our lives together. I wish I could've been there. Well, it was a few years before we met you, but you were there in our dreams that day. What's wrong? It's just... It's almost Christmas eve, and we still haven't found henry. [sighing] I know. He's so good at hiding, isn't he? [laughs] I mean, I guess we can't leave if we can't find him. What do you mean? We can't leave without henry. Sweetie, we can't stay here. Someone else is gonna be moving in. But mom gave him to me. We can't just forget about him. No, I mean, we're not just gonna forget. No matter where we go, we're always gonna have our good memories. Well, why can't we make more good memories here? Did we use them all up? We can't make more? [sighs] Come here. Tasha, hi. I just wanted to leave word and let you know that I'm actually going to be heading back a little earlier than expected. I should be in the office the day right after Christmas. Have a wonderful holiday. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Henry! Henry... You found him! Thank you! Where did you find him? In the bookshelf. In... The... Bookshelf. [Willow laughs] What made you look there? I found... My father's copy of a Christmas carol. I-I thought it was lost. I don't believe it. I do. I got my Christmas wish two whole days early. Aw. That's pretty amazing, sweetie. See, dad? We didn't run out of memories. No... We didn't. [♪♪♪] Hey. Hi. So when were you gonna tell me about this? Oh, just something I was carrying around for a few days. It's actually a proposal I put together about my company potentially investing in eagle ridge. Yes, I know. I read it. I just... I only did that because I thought it was what you might want. Look. I-I appreciate you putting so much work into this, really, but... I can't let you invest. I know that. Closure. I can't let you because... I'm keeping it. I called robert and told him that I'm pulling it off the market. But what about your job? What about being a partner? What about getting "back on track"? I think I need a new track. And I didn't realize that until... You showed me. You know, we talked about all the memories that we have of this place... Mm-hmm? And I just started thinking that mine were gone, lost, and then... I realized that we're creating new memories all the time. And I would love to continue making new memories with you. I would like that. Um... I probably need some help and I was thinking of hiring a manager... But I know you have a job. Well, I would consider it. On one condition. Name it. You have to let me paint. [laughs] Deal. You said you didn't know a good reason to want you to move back here. No. I said I'd know it when I saw it.
