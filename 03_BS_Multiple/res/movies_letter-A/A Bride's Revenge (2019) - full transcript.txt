That's part of why I have to break it off. - Huh. What about her family? - I mean, her dad, uh, dad left when she was nine. And he died, like, ten years later in a fire. She didn't talk about him very much. When she did, it was pretty bitter. Her mom I only met once, and she was already in some pretty advanced stages of dementia, so-- You know, honey, I didn't mean to hurt Lori. But I just--I couldn't marry her. And now I regret ever having met her. Look, why don't you, I don't know, take the day off tomorrow. Just relax. You know, let Sandra and Caroline cover the salon. - Okay. Yeah.

I got to admit, though, the whole thing does sound crazy. - I believe Miya, and Lori's just crazy enough to come up with something like this. She warned me. - What do you mean? - The day I broke it off, [panting] she says, uh, "You'll never be happy again," like it was some kind of curse. - Yeah, that doesn't surprise me. She was a witch. - [grunts] - Ah, come on. Lucky shot. I dare you, do that again. - Luck's got nothing to do with it. Anyway, brah, she can't put a curse on what you and Miya have, all right? - I sure hope not. - Dude, don't worry. She'll eventually go away, and you and Miya will be fine.

I know I tied him up. - Miya, please. Please, I don't want to rehash it anymore, okay? It was obviously an accident. Let's just leave it at that. I'm gonna go to bed.

I have season tickets. - I get off early on Wednesdays. I could go stay with her. Yeah, I'll add it to my schedule. - Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks. That'd also be a good time for you to tell her you're not gonna wear her wedding dress. - That would make for an entertaining evening. - No, absolutely not. You have to be there when I do that. - You're definitely on your own. - I'm taking you down with me. - Not a chance. - Oh, I guess the witch's ears were burning. - Hello, boys, Miya. What's the occasion? - We're tasting for the wedding party. - Oh. - What are you doing here? - I come here all the time. Best lobster bisque in town. By the way, Miya, I heard what happened with the bride. That must have been terrifying. - If it was an attempt to scare me, it didn't work. - Oh, well, I love the attitude, but I have no idea what you're talking about. On that note, I am not one to spoil a party, so I think my date and I will head over to Valentia's across the street. Have a good night. - You too. - Okay, that is the second time. We need to go to the police. - What are we gonna say? Uh, she remembers my mom's birthday, she loves lobster bisque? - Well, we should at least tell her date. - Tell him what? - Well, that he should run. Now.

Did you witness that? That woman is crazy. - I can't believe that. - Unbelievable. - Is it possible you were confused?

Found out about your mother, the carjacking a year ago. - What does that have to do with anything? - Well, losing someone to a violent crime like that, it's hard.

How long have they been waiting? - Long enough that Mr. Candler stepped in. - Okay. Thank you. - The detective confirmed that Lori's date was with her until he dropped her off at her house. - Well, maybe he's lying. Maybe they're in on it together. - Or maybe it really was the other bride you saw at the restaurant. - It wasn't. - Okay. - Well, then, if I were you, I'd turn around and throw it back in her face. Stalk her. - What is that gonna prove? - Maybe you can catch her in the act. - The only thing I have left in my day is a pedi, and then my afternoon's free until I see Deb tonight. - So go. You can watch her, see what she does, and we'll close up for you. - She works at an art gallery--Mouche, I think. - Yeah. That's over on the West Side. It's not far from here. - Okay, slow down. Are you sure you want to get that close to her? Because if it's not her stalking you, then this might all come back to bite you in the you-know-what. - But if it is, then I'll have the proof I need. - Fine.

He broke it off weeks ahead of time, but you're in some crazy state of denial. - Okay. Well, who's the one following his ex-fiancée around? And who's accusing me of stalking you dressed as some bride? If someone here seems crazy, that would be you. - Is that what you're playing at? You're trying to make me look like the crazy one. - I don't have to try. From where I stand, it's all very clear. Oh, and with Ian being so gun-shy of the "I dos," I mean, I'd be worried too. - Hey. Listen. Ian and I are getting married no matter what game you play, okay? - You take your hands off me right now. Oh, but before you do, smile at that camera. Bye. - Are you kidding me?

Why? - You were the only other one in the house, as far as we know. - Do you think I did this? - Under normal circumstances, I would think this was an accident. She had a bad hip.

Is he all right? - He's still unresponsive, but stable. - Okay. I don't understand. He was texting me. How is that possible? - It's possible that he regained consciousness for a few minutes. He would have been disoriented, so he likely tried to disconnect the IV and the machines. It's not uncommon, and the nurses got here right away. He wasn't in any real danger. Look, it's a good sign.

I retired a couple years ago. Who are you? - My name's Miya Ellerson. Sorry to just show up like this. I found your address in the phone book, thought I'd give it a shot. - Well, that's good detective work. [both chuckle] What can I do for you? - Well, I'm inquiring about a case of yours from 14 years ago, a fire that killed a man named Brady Parker. The fire marshal suspected arson, but no one was ever charged. - You with the media? - I have a personal connection to the family. I know Lori Parker. I was just wondering what really happened to her dad. Can you tell me if you ever had any suspects? - Uh, yeah, I questioned the family, including Lori. She was a teenager at the time. She had no involvement in the fire. - Really? - Yeah, she had a solid alibi. - Of course she did. Thanks anyway. - But her sister... [grunts] She didn't. - Her sister? - Yeah, Rose Parker. We had some evidence that she was there at the scene, just not enough to convict her. Given that and her age, the DA refused to press charges. It was a big mistake in my opinion. There was something definitely off about that girl. [phone beeps] - Um, I'm sorry, I have to go. Thank you. Thank you. You've been very helpful. Thank you. [medical machines beeping] - Ian. What's going on? Is he okay? - Yeah. Better. I mean, he's in and out all day, but... He spoke to me. - What did he say? - He said he saw the bride. I don't know. I think he was trying to tell me that that's why the car swerved. The doctors say not to take anything literally, that it's probably delusion or something. I didn't-- - He's not delusional. It's her. Or her sister. - What? - Lori has a sister. Rose Parker. - She never said anything to me about a sister. - The detective in Bakersfield said he suspected Rose might be behind her father's death. Maybe she's even crazier than Lori. Maybe she's the bride. Maybe that's the reason why Lori always has a perfect alibi. [doorbell rings] - Ian. What are you doing here? - Can I come in? - Sure. To what do I owe this pleasant surprise? - This isn't a social visit, Lori. I just want to ask you point blank. What the hell have you been doing? - Sorry, Ian. I'm a bit lost. - Really. Cut the bull. God, Miya was right. Ever since you reappeared, things have been falling apart. That is exactly what you wanted to happen, isn't it? - All right, I will tell you exactly what I told the detective. I have no idea what you're talking about. All the cops here know that I have nothing to do with any of your misfortunes. - What about your sister? [uneasy music] - My sister. - Rose, is it? The one you never told me about? - Yeah, well, why would I, since she abandoned us. - So you don't deny it. Hmm? You do have a sister? - She ran away when she was 16. She left me to take care of our mother after I'd already cared for them for so long. So you know what? I am so sorry that I neglected to tell you about her, but I accepted the fact that I didn't have a sister anymore the day she left. - Okay. Show me. Show me a photo of her. - I burned them. - Really? - Uh-huh. - I think you're lying. It's okay, 'cause I'm gonna find her. I'm gonna find her if that's the last thing I do. - Ian. - What? - You should really watch your threatening tone with me. I think the police are gonna want to talk to you about this. - You are crazy. You are crazy. - We need to end this. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. The 405 is officially my worst nightmare. - I have so much to tell you. Ian went and saw Lori this morning. - Wow. What happened? - I don't know yet. I haven't heard back. - Okay. Well, keep me posted. Okay. Well, I've got a 9:15, but maybe we could grab lunch. - When did you get those done? - Oh, Caroline did them for me when we were slow the other day. Aren't they cute? - A rose. - Yeah. - She likes my nails. - [chuckles] - I was just thinking, I've known you for, what, six months now? How come I never hear you talk about your family? - I don't know. Parents and I aren't exactly close. - How about your brothers and sisters? - I don't have any. Why the sudden interest? What's all this about? - You know so much about me, and I don't know anything about you. - Okay. Would you like me to tell you every little detail of my life? - No. Why do you always have a rose at your station? Is that your name? Rose? Are you Lori's sister? Are you the bride? - Whoa. Stop. I know you've got a lot going on right now, but I think I've heard just about enough here. I mean, I've had your back through all of this, and now you're accusing me? Of what? Of being that crazy lady's sister following you around? Of trying to kill you? No, I don't think so, Miya. You'll excuse me if I don't feel like having your back at this very moment, okay? Oh, and you know what? Take my 9:15. Tell her that you chased me off because I'm some crazy killer in a wedding gown. Hear that, everybody? Whoo! I'm freakin' crazy. Come on, Miya!

She's crazy, and I mean crazier than I thought. That's why I was there. I was just trying to cover myself. - What did she do? - I'll explain when I see you. You're going home after work, right? - Yeah. Ian... - Yeah? - Is it bad to think that Sandra is Rose? - At this point, I'd believe anything. Whether it's Sandra or not, one thing is for sure.
