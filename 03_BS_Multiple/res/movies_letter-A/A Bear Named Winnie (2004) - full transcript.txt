Cost you $35. Wait, now hold on. You know, I thought I wasjust doing you a favor. What do you want him for? I didn't say I wanted anything. I said I'd shoot her for you, if you like. Uh-huh. $25, and you can wangaway till cows give beer. Valcartier train now departing. All aboard! Valcartier, train leaving for Valcartier. All aboard! Excuse me, folks, I havea little situation here. I was wondering if you can-- Egads! No, she's not dangerous. She's just a little bit-- A regimental mascot, I'll bet. Regimental? No. I've just been a tad impetuous. Go give the Kaiser a goodkick in his royal Bosch behind. Oh, George! You shouldn't say that. Huh? All right, all right. I understand. I'm not really a bear sort of person, and I have a train to catch, which means I'm going to have to find you-- That your bear? You like bears? Hmm? You know that they makewonderful pets, far better than dogs. Did you know that? My dog died. Oh, I'm sorry. All aboard! You must be sad. Hey, what's your name? Timmy McMurray. Timmy McMurray. Well, I tell you what, Timmy McMurray. How would you like to have abear for your very own pet? Huh? Timmy. Get away from that man. Can we have the bear, Mommy? Bears make good pets. He said. Don't be silly, dear. Little children don't have bears for pets. Even big, brave soldiers know that. What am I going to do with you? Hmm? You're going to get me in trouble, aren't you? Aren't you? You're gonna get me in trouble. Who's your friend, Harry? She got a name? What were you thinking, Harry? Captain's not going to like this. I can't believe you got a bear, Harry. What's your name, little fella? Aww, she's a sweetie. Have you trained him yet? Is it a she? Is it a she-bear? Is this a she-bear? You bought her? I bought her. For how much? 20. Holy smokes, Harry. That-- That's a pair. You got a pair, there. - Yes, I do. Yes, I do. - Yes, you do. A wild bear. Thank you, Taylor. Wild bear on a train. Harry, what are you doing with that? To tell you the truth, Captain, it's not really an ambitionof mine to own a bear, but the circumstances were-- It's wild, sir. A wild bear. I can see that. Her mother was shot, and she was next. You know the rules. Yes, I do. He knows the rules. Taylor. Sorry, Harry, Captain. I'm, uh, just, uh-- You can't keep a pet. Pet? Is that what you think? Well, whatever it is, you can't keep it. That's the rule, is it? Afraid so. And rules are rules. There you have it. Well, there's no rule against having a mascot. Mascot? No rule against mascot. Unit mascot, what do you say, boys? This is an opportunity! Mascot with no name? Of course she's got a name. Uh-huh? Come on, Harry. Come on! Winnipeg. - That's right! Winnipeg? Is that a good name for a bear? Winnie for short. Winnie it is! Winnie. Yeah, I like that. Winnie. Winnipeg, all right.SOLDIER: Hey, Winnie! Winnie! Come here, Winnie! We've got a mascot. No bears on my train. Oh, uh-- Well, hold on now, sir. This is no ordinary bear, sir. No exceptions. He's the, uh-- Uh, she's. She's the unit mascot. I don't give a hoot if she'sthe King's great-grandmother. I won't have a beardefecating all over my train. She's not defecating. Will be. You can count on it. You can count on that. Sir, we're allwith the Veterinary Corps. We've all been trained to deal with animals of all shapes and sizes. Look, sunshine. Wild critters don't give twohoots where they defecate, and this here one won't be defecating where it's against the rules. And that would be in first-class coach. You want to keep a bear? You keep it in freight. Crawford. Sir? Good morning, sir. And what the devil do theythink they're doing with those? Osbourn. - Sir! Pack my charger. Absolute mess. What do you think it is? It's nothing but a mess. And there's no drainage here. Move the tents up the slope. Yes, sir. And for heaven's sake, keep them in rows. You can't have tents helter-skelter all over the place. Order and discipline, lads. That's what wins wars. Yes, sir. - Carry on. - Sir! Crawford. What do you make of that ragtagbunch at the end of the ranks? Veterinary Corps, sir, Winnipeg Section. Blasted cowboys. Fetch, uh, what's his name? That new man. Come on, what's his name? What's his name? Colonel Barret, sir. Barret, thank you. Have him deal with it. Yes, sir. Canadian Army VeterinaryCorps, Winnipeg Section reporting for duty, sir. Prepare for inspection. I'm Barret, Chief VeterinaryOfficer and Director of Veterinary Services. I don't care who your fatheris, what school you went to, or any of that high-brow baloney. As of this moment you represent your country as part of the 1st Division of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. From all the information I can gather and what I can see with my own two eyes, your military training has been slight to nil. That's Winnie, sir. Short for Winnipeg. Our unit mascot, sir! Get rid of it. Eyes front! I don't believe in mascots, and you men must close your picnic hampers and begin to harden your hearts. What you are about to face is more vicious and terrifying than anything you can possibly imagine. Carry on. You can't just leave her in the woods. There's wolves and foxes and coyotes and-- Thank you, Corporal. She wants you to, um-- Yes, I'm aware of that. Yeah, it can't be this row. It's got to be the next row. Well, maybe another regiment will take her. I mean there's no regulation-- The order was to get rid of her. Well, you never used to follow orders. Yes, we're having a lovely little war, now though, aren't we? Harry. I think we found your billet. Get up there! Why are you being such a-- Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Can we give you a hand? No. No, thank you. I'm Harry Colebourn. This is Captain Elliot. Oh, oh yes, hello. Uh, Ian Macray, formerKings College scholar now colonial fodder for a pompous imperial empire. Let me. We're tentmates, I think. Oh. Well. As a man thinks, so he becomes. Huh? Harry, I have some news, andyou're not going to like it. I-- I was tying her up righthere, and then I looked away. And then I looked back, andshe-- she- she was gone. Taylor! All right, split up. Let's go! Wh-- wh-- who-- who's gone? It's Winnie. Who's Winnie? It's our bear. Oh. Have you seen a black bear cub through here? Is his mother around? Here we go. Anything? No. What's going on? Bear! Get back here! Get out of my kitchen, get out! Get out! Hold on! Hey. Enough, bear. Back to the woods with you. Come here. Ten-hut! Fine thing, mascot. Had one myself once in South Africa. Sir Hugo. Supercilious old billy goat. Took his last time with us at Paardeberg Drift. Stray flare caught the munitions, and dear old fellow burnt to a crisp inthe of. Yes, well, in any event hewas awfully good for morale. They're noble creatures, bears. You make sure you look after him, Major. It's Lieutenant, sir. And move this tent! It's a pig sty! Do you know why we don'thave women in the army? Actually, sir, I've often wondered. When the shooting starts, the men rush to protect. To fight and live requiresa soldier's full attention. Eye on the ball, not the bear. Yes, sir, but the general seems quite adamant about having a mascot as-- Yes, I understand the situation. You have a week or so. Do what you need to doto take care of your bear before we leave for England. Yes, sir. So they have teeth, ofcourse, and the intestinal tract of a carnivore. But-- Come here. Winnie. Uh, but they, um, they'reopportunistic eaters and-- which makes them omnivorous and explains their fondness for ants. She'd have to eat a great number. Yes, that would be a factor, wouldn't it. It says here their olfactory sense-- that means you-- is more acute than a dog's by the power of seven. Isn't that amazing? Yeah, that's why their noses are bigger. Huh? Oh! Actually-- Winnie, come down from there. Winnie! Her-- her preferred foods are, um, nuts, acorns, insects, uh-- Winnie bear. - --Succulent greens, and honey.- Winnie! And, um, and, uh, berries. Winnie! Winnie! But, uh, but I think-- I think it's a little late inthe season for-- for berries. Oh dear! - Winnie bear! Winnie bear! Oh! You know a lot about bears, do you? Well, not much I don't know about, really. I thought so. Yes. I think what's important isthat she needs to learn how to defend herself and forage for herself and, uh, and to sleep-- oh! And to sleep alone. Winnie! Winnie! Wonderful, isn't it? Macray, no offense intended, but what in the name of glory are you doing in uniform? Know everything, done nothing. That's me in a nutshell. What? What? You hungry? Don't wake him up. Don't wake him up. Go back. Come here. Winnie! Winnie! Taste good? Comeon, everybody. Pull those tents down! Up. Up. Good Winnie. Good. Good Winnie. Good bear. Wha-- wha-- what's--what are you-- that's-- no, the-- the horse is-- This horse is old and sick. What-- no, they don't have to do that. No, no. She's contagious. But no, it's not. I've ruled it out. It's not epizootic lymphangitis, and it's not glanders or farcy either. - Really? - Yes, really. There's a swelling. It's a-- a-- a-- ch-- perhaps a boil or maybe a splinter. A splinter? Yes! Sergeant Major. Professor Macray here seems tothink old Zeb's fit and able. This animal? I can see he is sick. Just give me a minute. Easy. Easy, Zeb. Easy. Hey, good boy. Good. Shh. Oh. It's all right. Steady. Come here. Atta boy. Atta boy. Up, up, up. Oh! Easy. Easy. Shh. Atta boy. Atta boy. Easy. Easy. Good boy. Good boy. Shh. Atta boy. Atta boy. Easy, easy. Good boy. Shh. Good boy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Good boy. Good boy. Come here. Come here. Want some apple, huh? Comeon, pull those tents down. And move this tent! Ready and pull! I said pull, you lummox. Just slow and steady effort, the way you would remove a burr from a cat. Ready and pull! General, may I have a word? General Hallholland, theconstant relocation of tents robs the men of valuable time for training-- I understand you graduatedtop of your class at RMC. Sir, the men need practical training. They have no idea what's facing them in France So you must be related tothe Montreal Barrets, huh? Old Charlie Barret and I, we played rugby together at McGill. My father was a miner, barely spoke English, and as far as I know he never played any type of game his entire life. Oh. We depart by convoy in 48 hours. That will be all. No,. Stampede! Come on, let's go. Stampede! Wake up! Go, go! Stampede at the stables! Stampede! They all went down that way. Harry! Harry! But there must have beensomething that bothered them, and, uh, it was dark. It was night. I just-- I wish I could have seen. What did you see? See? Well, I-- I didn't see. What I mean is that it-- itwas dark, and it was quiet. And then all of a sudden, uh, you know, they were kicking or-- or-- Harry! Find it. Yes, sir. Still some are missing. Look down by the river. Bear. What you have done? This is not good. Unless you have any pertinent remarks. Sir, there's no evidencethat says that Winnie caused that stampede. She's wild. That's all the evidence necessary. Sir? Respectfully, I decline onthe grounds of an oath which each and every one of us swore to uphold, to use our skills for the benefit of society through the protection of animal health and the relief of animal suffering, sir. All right, Lieutenant. No! Winnie didn't do it. What happened was I saw that oldmongrel dog run past on the way out of the stables, and-- Did you see it enter the stables? Well, I-- that-- that--that's just the-- that's just the thing, sir. I-- I was, uh-- I must have-- Sir, I fell asleep at my post, sir. That's a court martial offense, Corporal. Lieutenant, we strike camp at 0800. We'll take care of it, sir. I'm awful sorry, Harry. I-- you know, I wouldn't do anything to hurt-- I know. I know. I'm sorry. Easy. I'm going to set herdown over here in this clearing. Oh, easy, girl! Easy, girl. That's it. What d-- What does she want? What does she want from me? Look, there's some raisins in my bag down there, in the satchel. Girl, good girl. No, she wants out. I don't have the raisins, Harry. We left the raisins. You're doing great. She's attacking. I'm-- Hello. Good. Good Winnie. I'm not sure if she likes me or not. I thought you knew about bears! Winnie. Winnie. These berries? Uh, bunchberries, cornus canadensis. They are very tasty for bears, but sadly dried up and out of season now. Blueberries. Yes, perfect. Perfect. Come on! Come on, Winnie. - Show her those. - Come on. Come on. Come on. Look, see? Berries! Berries! Look, berries. Good. Good girl. Good girl. Shh. Easy. Easy. Easy. Shh. OK, go. Go. I can't help feeling we're abandoning her. Well, perhaps we should think of it as returning her to her rightfulplace in the great chain of-- Macray. Yes, well, she is unusually clever, an extraordinary bear, really, asurvivor if there ever was one. Don't you think? Do you have any ideas? You're the smart one. Well, not like her. OK, I'm going to put her down right here. Let's go! Move! Move! Can she get out of it? I think, judging by her past performance. You're right. You're right. Won't take you long, will it, Winnie? Hmm? This is where you belong, girl. You'll be fine here, OK? Good-bye. Good-bye, Winnie. Forgive my impertinence, Harry, but you're not Canadian-born, are you? Or rather, I-- I mean I canjust detect a slight hint of-- My father died when I was young. Mother remarried. I was sent out here at 14. My uncle's with the grain exchange. That's interesting. Is it? No, no, no, no, no, no. No, it's nothing really. I just-- Nothing? If a simple veterinarian from Winnipeg, Manitoba, is interesting at all, I want to know about it. Well, it's simply that, um, what I find interesting is that-- well, your sensitivity towardsWinnie being abandoned when-- when you've experienced something similar yourself, in a manner of speaking, more or less. My good old dad came out herewith a piddling remittance. You know, the black sheep ofthe family, the feckless son who just couldn't measure up, and sent to the new world to seek his fortune. And unfortunately his family was right. And my mother, well, she taughtschool, and she still does. All of which I suppose explains why I-- I can speak Latin, but Ican't swim or throw a ball. When this rotten war is over, no more soldiering for me. When I get my civvy clotheson, oh, how happy I shall be. No more church parades on Sunday. No more putting in for leave. I shall miss that SergeantMajor, how I'll miss him, how he'll grieve. When this rotten war is over, no more soldiering for me. When I get my civvy clotheson, oh, how happy I shall be. I shall sound my own reveille. I shall make my own tattoo. Now this, I must have. I can't do without. You know, it's al-- it's alwaysDickens or-- or Longfellow. Do you find? I find that it-- No! Winnie! Where did you come from? Winnie! That's-- that's Winnie! She-- She's here, but I thought that you-- well, it is good that she's here? No, it's not. It's not so good, but it'scertainly extraordinary. Whoa, what are you going to do? Because I mean, she's not so wild anymore. She obviously likes people. We can't? No. Wh-- wh-- yeah, but we can'ttake her with us, either. We-- I mean, what are you going to do? Smuggle her in your-- in your haversack? This is not good. I hope this works. Private. Leonard, right? Well, Leonard-- Let's-- let's go. Over there. We got this, Jake. A big strapping fellow such as yourself. Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. In a few weeks you will standagainst the Prussian army, the greatest, strongest, mostprofessional, well-trained military machine in the world. I suggest over the next weekyou take a few moments to plan how you intend to stay alive. Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. Here, have one of these. Oh, lovely. Our-- our dressing stationsare well behind our lines, so we're not going to see any real action. Technically we're still in rangeof their guns so there's always the off-chance-- One-ton shell might blow us into next year. Right. But what are the odds? What-- What do you think, Harry? Wh-- What are the odds? I think I've made a terrible blunder. We can't take Winnie to war. To the front line? - No. She'll end up like old Sir Hugo. Or worse. You're right. Harry. What I'm trying to figure is, if Zeb's back to his old self, then there must be a reason whyyou want to keep him inside. Well, I don't think anotherday or two of reprieve would hurt. Would it, Taylor? Oh. No, no, no. Wait. I-- I think I know. It-- it's because of her, isn't it? Yes, it is. It's-- it's because you don'twant Winnie getting lonely, because boy oh boy, if she gets lonely, then the first thing she'sgoing to do is run to camp. And then the Colonel and everybody-- Thank you, Taylor. Sorry, Harry. Just uh, just had towork that out a bit, huh? Just, just work it out. The front is no place for you either, is it? Huh? Old man. Now you be a brave bear and look after Taylor. We'll be back as soon as we can, all right? You know what to do if the brass turns up. Sure do. Girl. We should get there in plenty of time. Wait, wait, wait a minute. We never discussed we. It was always you. The situation's changed. It needs to be we. What? In any event it will be a walk in the park. Harry, I'm afraid I'm not terribly brave. Haha, you'll get over that. No, one does not get over a firing squad. Sir. Sir. Excuse me, sir. Sir. Canadian Army, VeterinaryCorps, Winnipeg Section ready for inspection, sir! At ease, Corporal. Where is she? I have no idea what you mean, sir. No idea whatsoever? Well, yes, sir. Well, no, sir. I-- no idea whatsoever, sir. Very well. I know she was on the boat. I have evidence, and I know she's here. And when I get to the bottom ofall of this, the bunch of you will be finding yourselvesfacing disgrace, dishonor, and a punishment so cruelonly English schoolboys could have thought of it. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Understand, sir. No idea whatsoever, sir. Barret. This is uh, this is from Whitehall. And uh, ha! I don't know what-- I mean, what the hell do they know. I know they need the because apparently it's machine guns that are going to win this war. Listen. "Each one replaces 80 rifles." Codswallop, isn't it? I mean, what-- and what if it jams? Eh? What then? Well, no, sir. Thank you very much. I'll take the 80 rifles and a crack cavalry. It's horses that are key to this fight. And they always have been, and they always will be. What do you think, Colonel? General, may I speak candidly? Crawford. Sir! General, I recommend youlift your ban on alcohol for our boys and loosen the restrictions you've imposed with regardto leaving the base. Impose? I don't impose orders, boy. I give 'em. And I expect them to be followed by everyone. Sir, the men need to letoff steam every now and then. Yeah, and it's, um, it's clean living that keeps my lads sharp, and that means no liquor. And if they have to go looking for it off-base, well, they'll be shot. Will that be all, Colonel? Men prepared to sacrificetheir lives for their country should not be treated as children. Don't you tell me how to run my army. General, the Canadian Expeditionary Force is not your private army, and I will not stand by while the lives of 30,000 men are compromised by some vainglorious whim. Who the hell do you think you are? Don't you dare talk to me like that! Do you know who I am? Do you realize the prime minister-- your father was a nothing, a nobody, and that's exactly where you'll end up if I have any say in the matter. Sir, the sun is aboutto set on your day to have a say in anything that matters. And as to your other point, my father didn't need to wear a uniform to be a man of honor. Get off! Morning, Colonel. I knew it. Come over here. Come here, you. OK, don't-- don't--don't do this to me, bear. I don't-- we-- no, this doesn't work with-- OK. OK. Oh, my goodness, you stink. I know exactly where you've been. Come on, let's go. Corporal, we need to have a chat. Did you sleep well? Hmm? Hmm? No problems last night? No, sir-- Harry. Are you all right? Yeah, everything's fine. Just another day in-- Gasoline, oil, and oxygen.It's highly combustible. That's what makes the engine go. Yes, I know, but, uh, what I'mwondering is whether, uh, well, between here and where we'regoing, we-- we wouldn't be in harm's way at all, would we? Harry, are you positive this is the only way? It's the only fence that's not patrolled. Get down! Down! Down! That would be the reason why. Cease fire! You, there! That's no way to treat your weapon. Sir? This here Ross rifle's a terrible piece of junk. Heats up. Jams up all the time. Breech explodes. Can't shoot straight, even if I'm trying to- It's a poor workman who blames his tools! Yes, sir! All right, listen up, everybody. Get down! Now let me tell you the Rossrepeater is the most perfect military rifle in the world. I helped modify it. This weapon is the mostaccurate weapon ever fired. Every single one of you should be able to pink his enemy every time. Come on. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Harry, I must say I feel rather exposed. Here, take Winnie. Not to worry, with this little beaut we will be there and back in no time. There's not a lot of roomthere for me and the bear, is it? What's that? 24-hour pass for both of us-- What? --Signed by-- Barret! Do-- do you have any idea what just occurred? I think I do. All right, Winnie. It's time for you to do your business. Still have a fair ways to go. We don't want you to be doingyour business in the sidecar as there's not much room for abear's business in the sidecar. Harry, I've been, uh-- Thinking? Indeed. About? Well, should anything unfortunate occur, I would like my mother to, um-- you see, she wasn't for this. It would be my honor. Thank you. But it won't come to that. Oh, no? Well, you haven't swallowedthat home by Christmas nonsense, have you? No. Then? Faith. That's funny. What? I wouldn't have taken youfor a man of the church. Faith in you. Henry, come look and at this! He's a beast, isn't he? Ah, look at him. She is, uh, clean, isn't she? It doesn't do to, uh, muck up a zoo with some mangy, flea-ridden creature. They spread disease, you know. Bears have their own diseases, of course, but they affect other animals. Had a cross-infection betweena giraffe and a beaver once. Very nasty. Well, here we are. One of our larger, more spacious enclosures. As secure and reliable as the Pope has penury. Oh, now listen. I shouldn't worry. She'll soon accustom herself. They all do. Winnie's used to a fairbit of human companionship, Mr. Protheroe. She-- She's been tamed, you see. Yeah, completely tamed. Yes, well, no animal is evercompletely tame, are they? Winnie's different. Look, I can't take risks, notas far as the general public is concerned. We know her. Intimately. Uh, well, so-- so to speak. She needs human contact. Yes, well, she'll have me and the underkeepers. We're perfectly convivial. I don't think youunderstand, Mr. Protheroe. Believe me, Lieutenant. I have worked with bears for the past 20 years. Yes, they can be beguiling. They have a-- a knack of amusing us and putting us at our ease, so to speak. But believe me when I tell you this, you can never lower your guard, not for an instant, not with bears. I don't think Winnie knows she's a bear. Yes, well, listen, I've got to lock up, so you, uh, say your final goodbyes. All right? Hey, we have to goaway for a while, Winnie. OK? No place for bears, so you have to stay here. You understand? Mr. Protheroe's going to look after you now. Stop. Winnie. Winnie, play fair. Play fair. You're an impossible bear, you know that? This is what we're going to do. I'm going to come back, and we'll get in a ship. And we'll go back to Canada. We'll go home together, promise. You take care. You'll be fine here. All right? Harry? I've got a bad feeling. Time to eat, Winnie. Lovely bits of fresh fruit. I cut it meself. Come on, girl. Any luck? Same as every day, sir. Won't touch nothing. That was peculiar. What, sir? Oh, the way she just looked at me. I could have sworn-- Just curious, probably. No, it was more than that. It was her eyes. It wasn't like an animal at all. It was as if she could see what I was thinking. Whatever she is, sir, she's gonna starve. Yeah, well, I'm afraid itmay be past that point already. Well, she's really not lookingvery well at all, is she? No. I don't like the look of her. You know, I think she's missing the soldiers. Is it not very well? What's wrong with the bear? Have you seen a child come by? A little girl. She's wearing a blue dress, and-- it's a green dress with, um, brocade. She had a little gold locket. Her name is Muriel. - Muriel? Muriel McGuiness. Oh. Hello. Do you like biccies? Here you are. Ahh! Uhh. Ohh. Oh. - Muriel! - Your gun, sir. Muriel, sweetheart! Darling, come to me! The bear's escaped! Miss McGuiness! Muriel! Oh. Muriel. A little bear. Prime minister impatientwith his eccentric ways. Well, that's a surprise. Come on, let's move it! All right, all right. To the Eastern flank. Battalion's falling back. Where are they coming from? Through Wood. Oof! My men are there! Pass me that one. Thanks. Here you go, Zeb. Huh? Do you like that? Huh? We're going to get you home, Zeb. OK? All right, come on. You're a handsome old man, huh. Elliot? Macray! Macray, it's Harry. They're all gone. Goodbye. Goodbye, old man. Macray, we've got to get out of here. I-- I was wrong, Harry. I was dead wrong. About what? A man doesn't become what he thinks. He becomes what he does. He becomes what he does. He becomes what he does. Macray! Quick. Harry! I know the way. This way now. So why don't youstep inside, and then I-- I'll have another look at it. Won't go outside. Won't leave the room. Most days he won't even get off bed. Just lies there. Doesn't let any of it out. What those poor boys had to go through. How can I help him? Does he speak? Little, not much. About? His friend, mostly, the one who was killed. Macray. And sometimes at night, he whispers a name. His mother or girlfriend, I suppose. Do you know her, sir? Who's that? Winnie. What's that? Look! What the-- What's that doing here? Gah, keep it away! Gracious! You might as well-- What is it? What on earth! Visitor for you, Captain Colebourn. Winnie! It's you. Look at you. You got so big. You got so big. Hey, Winnie. Hey, Winnie. Good girl. Yeah, good girl. Good girl. Yeah? It's a remarkable bear! Wave for Harry? Missed you so much. I missed you. Good bear. Shh. There's a good bear. It's all over. It's hard to imagine. - You can go home. - Home. Winnie too, but this time, not in my trunk. Thank you, sir. You did a hell of a job, Harry. You all did. Fine brave hearts, every one of you. Thank you, General. Transfer's all in order, Captain. Inoculation jabs, delousing, and so forth. Oh, the blue one you have toshow to immigration in Canada. Shouldn't be a problem, though, should it? Of course, she's a Canadian citizen. Thank you very much, Mr. Protheroe. I'm very grateful for everything you've done. Grateful? That's a. Grateful. She's the most infamous animal in our keep, sir. A fair bit of human companionship, I think that's how you put it. Do you remember? Ha! I mean, look at them. They can't keep away from her. Horrible little hatchlings. Overrun the entire area, they do. They come in droves. And on Sundays, well, it taxes a Christian heart. Need a herd dog to get them away. I love my zoo, understand. It's just those pesky little-- yes, well-- --it's not an issue anymore, is it? Mr. Protheroe, what would you say if-- what I'm thinking is Winnie seems to have find herself a home. Home? Here, at the zoo. You can see how she adores them. Them? What do you mean-- Oh no, no, no. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. You can't go back on your word. Besides, I've already given you the-- the paper-- No bear could be better lovednor have a greater purpose. The bear is not the problem. It's them. They-- They drop their sticky wrappers. They-- They kick up a ruckus. They-- They scare the monkeys. Animals are one thing kept, butthose sticky, thankless vermin. I'd better say goodbye. Hey. I guess this is it, old girl, huh? Hmm? Huh? You know I'll come back and see you, don't you? Hey. No, I promise. Why am I telling you anything, huh? You're just a bear. Extraordinary bear. You know that, don't you? Huh? Of course you do. You know I love you. Huh? You'll be fine. Where do you think shelived before she lived here? Where do you think, my boy? Well, I imagine in the woods. You're probably right. What did she eat? Why don't you ask Edward? He's not Edward. He's not? Not anymore. No? He's Winnie. Winnie? Yes. There once was a bear name Winnie. Who lived in the wood. And who loved to eat honey. Honey!
