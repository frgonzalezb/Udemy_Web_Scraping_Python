foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- I just missed your heart. You're dead. Right now. I've killed you. Use your hands! Drag that deer back yourself. What's wrong? Are you hurt? You were half asleep. You must always be ready. Even when you're sleeping. Think on your feet. Adapt... Or die. I'll do better next time. German. Italian. Spanish. How much did you pull off the deer? 120 with scraps. 200 pounds in total. I think so. That explains it. What? How you beat me. You're getting strong. "The great blue whale is the largest animal to have ever existed. "Its heart weighs 1300 pounds, "and a male has 7 gallons of "testicles. "The blue whale's music can be heard for over 500 miles. "A blue whale's tongue weighs over two and a half tons." What does music feel like? "Music. A combination of sounds, "with a view to beauty of form and expression of emotion." I want to hear it for myself. We have all we need right here. It's not enough. I'm ready. Papa, I'm ready. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two... I live in Leipzig. German city. Population 0. 7 million peoples. Tell me again. Wilhelm Grimm's house. Stephanstrasse 260. 10559 Berlin, Germany. We live at number 7 Weissingerplatz. I go to school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium, and my best friends are Rudi Gunther and Clara Schliess. Wilhelm Grimm's house. Stephanstrasse 260. 10559 Berlin, Germany. I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics. We live at number 7 Weissingerplatz. I go to school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium, and my best friends are Rudi Gunther and Clara Schliess. I also have a dog called Trudi. I'm ready. I'm ready now. ...26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37. Did you see it? Did you hear it? It's like thunder. It was so beautiful. What is it? It tells Marissa Wiegler where we are. If you think you're ready and you want to leave here, all you have to do is flip that switch. But once it's done, there's no going back. She won't stop until you're dead. Or she is. You understand? I won't be there to hold your hand. So be sure. Be sure it's what you really want. It's here. There's no rush. "Laika, a mongrel dog from the streets of Moscow "was the first animal to orbit the Earth. "She was launched into outer space "on the 3rd of November, 1957. "Scientists believed humans would be unable "to survive conditions of outer space, "so flights by animals were viewed as an experimental precursor "to human missions. "Her rocket was not designed to be retrievable, "and Laika had always been intended to die." But she didn't, did she? They couldn't bring the rocket back, remember? I remember. But sometimes I wish you would read it differently. "When a star collapses, "the supernova explosion is 10 billion times "brighter than the other stars." Will you hunt with me? If you want. It's up to you. Me? Yes. I'll stay. Yes. Good. Marissa Wiegler. Come and find me. You were lucky you caught that deer. There was nothing out there today. It smells good. When will it be ready? Soon. We picked up an unencrypted signal. One of ours. - When? - 0632 Eastern Standard. Triangulated about 60 miles below the Arctic Circle. Near Kuusamo. We think it's Erik Heller. Erik Heller? You were his handler, right? Sure. Name sounds familiar. Fuck, Erik. Why now? How does it look? Good. Almost good. Erik Heller. Recruited in 1991. Former FSK operative. He became integral to our counterintelligence ops in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. His file ends in '94. And there was no sign of life until April 18th, 1996 when his fingerprints were found on a.22 caliber Luger found beside the body of one Johanna Zadeck. Johanna Zadeck. Born 1970. German. She was spotted and developed by Heller in 1994. Never recruited. Why was she being developed? That's not in the file. Let's keep on task. Heller is a rogue asset. I propose we go in and pull him out. We've got bigger problems, Marissa. Let Interpol pick him up. He's no longer our responsibility. Interpol nabs him, then exposes him to BND, FSB, France. Do you really want every intelligence agency in Europe scratching at this thread? - Lewis? - I'm sorry, but we need to keep this contained, gentlemen. Keep it small. I worked with this man. He knows things I don't think you wanna know. I appreciate your candor. What do you need, Lewis? One man, one day operation. - Tell me again. Then? - Marissa Wiegler. - Postcard. - Then? What? The address where we meet. Wilhelm Grimm's house. Stephanstrasse 260. 10559 Berlin, Germany. What else? Adapt or die. Think on your feet. Even when I'm sleeping. Papa... Remember what I taught you. You'll be fine. I'll see you there. Entry 1, copy. I'm on target. 5 right. Sky Guard. Flank 1, clear. Watch your step. He knows we're coming. Entry 1, copy. Downrange, you're clear. - Alpha moving. - Move! McCullum, do you read me? Sky Guard, over. McCullum? I repeat, McCullum, do you read me? Go, go, go! Go, Bravo, go! We got men down! We need help! We need a medic! Secure the area! Erik Heller escaped. How did that happen? Unclear. We think he got away in the snowstorm or... But he's in the wind, and I've got 2 men down. - "One man, one day operation." There were a lot of variables. - Just find him, Lewis. - Poor visibility, ...he knows the land, shit intel. - Find him and bring him to me. There was a kid. Things got out of our control. Wiegler? Wiegler, are you there? Where is she now? Hello, Hanna. Hello. My name's Dr. Burton. Would you like to talk to me? I was told by my father to gain the upper hand. That's very interesting. What else did your father tell you? Where am I? You're in holding. I've never been in a room like this. It must all be very strange for you. How long have you been in the forest? Hanna? Are those cameras? Uh-huh. They're taking our picture right now. To keep a record. How does that make you feel? Camera obscura. It's Latin for "dark chamber." It was first described by the Arabic scientist Ibn Alhazen in the year 1021. Plug the CCTV through to Langley. Yeah, you should have visual on the psych evaluation now. Can I get you something? What do you like? Music? Magazines? Just ask. Anything at all. I want to speak to Marissa Wiegler. Tell her I'll be there tonight. I can handle this. Just do what you're told. John, take a look at this kid's blood sample. Is that right? - Is it? - Can't be right. I got a sample of her hair. Must be contaminated. Run it again. My name is Marissa Wiegler. You wanted to speak with me? You can wait outside. Where am I? You're in a safe place, sweetie. Where did you meet my father? Erik. You mean Erik? Yes. I met him by a news kiosk in Alexanderplatz, East Berlin. I met him at a news kiosk. Alexanderplatz. Say it was raining. In the rain. He had just arrived from Prague. Just arrived from Prague. He had just arrived from Prague. Do you know where your father is? Did he tell you where he was going? We're all worried about him. It's okay. Agent, keep your distance. It's okay. It's okay. You want me to give her something? I think that might be necessary. Abort. Open up. I repeat, Agent, abort. Oh, my! Wiegler! Wiegler! Target is in sector 3. Shut it down! Shut it down! Lord, help me. - You think she got out? - She can't get out! Who's on the perimeter? Detail every unit available. Mama! She will never be yours. She will never be yours. Hey. Hello? Don't you speak English? It's not your fault if you can't. MIA couldn't speak English until she was 8 because she was, like, a refugee or something from Sri Lanka. And now she's a pop star. In America, too. So don't worry if you can't speak English yet. Who's she? I found her. She can't speak English. She's from Sri Lanka. I'm from Germany. Oh. I live in Leipzig. Population 0.7 million peoples. We live at number 7 Weissingerplatz. I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics. I go to school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium, and my best friends are Rudi Gunther and Clara Schliess. They sound fun. I also have a dog called Trudi. We had a dog called Vincent. But he went mad and died. Sophie! Sophie! See you. Sophie! Come on! I'm Sophie, and that's my brother, Miles. I'm Hanna. Do you need a lift somewhere? No. I prefer to walk. Suit yourself. Sophie, come on. We're all waiting for you. Tactical says she's in the desert southeast of Essaouira. Focus all operations on Heller. Are you saying the girl is not of interest to us? Yes, of course, she's of interest, Lewis, but not an immediate threat to the security of the United States of America. Erik Heller is the immediate threat. Focus on Heller. Where is your family? Are you Arab? I'm Moroccan. Morocco. Capital city: Rabat. Places of interest: Marrakech, Essaouira. Religion: Islam. Language: Arabic. It's the German girl! Is "Kraut" an ethnic slur? Like "queer" or "lesbo"? I think I'd quite like to be a lesbian. But not one of those fat ones. One who's, like, a supermodel. But we'd only hold hands, and I think I'd probably marry a man. What? No kiss? She's a bit old for you, isn't she? She has male and female genitalias. And you love her just the way she is. I like to give people what they want. I'll save it for when I need it. What do you want, Marissa? Erik Heller is still alive. Of course. And the girl. Ah. Why are you here? Be concise. I need you. You need me? Little old me? I'm very flattered. I need your talents, darling. I need you to do things my agency will not let me do. The devil is in the details, isn't he? It's the girl or Erik? She's in Morocco. It's all in the envelope. Let me worry about Erik. Shall I kill her? Just find her. Marissa. Did she turn out as you hoped? Better. She was married to this footballer and gave him lots of advice about how to spend his money and do his tax. 'Cause even though she's beautiful, she's actually brilliant with money. Get off! Like, for their anniversary, he said, "Here's 15 grand "toward a Hermes Kelly bag or a boob job." Now, she said she knew the boob implants would have to be replaced every 10 years, but that the Hermes Kelly bag never depreciates in value. - That's enough with the boob jobs. - That's just common sense. That's why everybody loves her. Mum is against plastic surgery. I am. Mum doesn't even wear makeup. I don't. I think it's dishonest. This is my face. Take it or leave it. If you study history of art or anthropology... Rachel got her first at Cambridge. ...you learn that red lipstick mimics arousal and suggests the geography of the labia minora. Puke! Whereas, I have a lot of natural red pigment in my lips so I really don't need it. - Vomitorium! - Soph... - It's embarrassing! - Just grow up, all right? - Grow up? - Yeah. Oh, because yesterday Mum was saying I shouldn't act beyond my years. It does leave her with mixed messages, darling. Because we're trying to communicate to her how to enjoy childhood. I just want her to stop saying "vomitorium." All right? Oy, it's not funny. So, Hanna... Hanna? I'm quite impressed about you traveling around on your own. My father encourages me to be independent. You see, that's wonderful. - I was backpacking at your age. - Where is he? Your father? I spent a heavenly summer just island hopping around Greece... Bed hopping around Greece. What? No, it's valuable. Our experience makes us who we are. Isn't that right, kids? So, Hanna, is your mum and dad still together? My mother is dead. Nice one, Dad. I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my mum when I was very young. So... It's all right. It happened a long time ago. Hanna, what did your mum die of? Three bullets. Oh, my God, that's appalling. "A combination of sounds, "with a view to beauty of form "and expression of emotion." "Abnormal." What happens if it rains? Well, you're gonna get wet, aren't you? Because someone broke the sunroof and seeing as me and your mother are... "Your mother and I." Seeing as me and your mother, your mother and I, are responsible adults, it leaves you two. My fungal nail infection's back. Is there gonna be a swimming pool where we're going? - Yeah, there'll be a swimming pool. - Yes! - Yes, there will be. - Have you packed up the bags? I don't understand why VIP means after the illegal immigrants and the goats. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Let's play "shut up" for 20 seconds, everyone. Yeah! Go, go, go! Shh. I've contacted Interpol. On whose authority? Walt. We can't keep this to ourselves anymore. Were you not listening? He killed 2 policemen. He's reframed the situation. It is out of our control. Then we must regain control, Mr. Lewis. I am the first and the last person Erik Heller will see. Are we clear? Are we clear, Mr. Lewis? Yes, ma'am. Oh, my God! What are you doing here? The sunroof. Was it you? Would it be very bad if it was? You mean, you were in the van the whole time? My dad would have a heart attack if he found out. Will you have to tell him? Hanna! You are so mental. Of course, I'm not going to tell him. I think it's brilliant. Have you got anywhere to stay? No. Yes, you do. You're staying with me. I am? Yeah, obviously. I'm sneaking you in on one condition. What? These boys. Spanish. Gorgeous. No, don't look. They're not all preeny about it like footballers. Haven't got their eyebrows waxed or anything. Good. Anyway, I'm meeting them tonight, and you have to come. All right. God, you're not hard to convince. Ho. Ho? Got anything to wear? You can't wear those. You look like some mad German. Are you scared? Of what? Are we going to kiss now? Would you like to? Kissing requires a total of 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles. The most important muscle involved is the orbicularis oris muscle because it is used to pucker the lips. Hanna, you mentalist! Please, tell your friend I just wanted a kiss. Hanna! Should I let him go? As opposed to what? Yes, you should let him go! I'm going to go now. Okay. It was nice. Sophie? Is that you? Oh, my God, they're at it like rabbits. That's so embarrassing. At what? I can't believe you. Hello, Mama. I know you're disappointed in me. I know it. I'm so sorry, Mama. But... But maybe I have found a way to make it better. I'm in a program now, a program to make babies stronger. It's an American program. Very scientific... Hanna. Hanna? Yes? Where do you really come from? Leipzig. I live in Leipzig. If we're going to be friends, you're going to have to be honest with me. Them's the rules. Are we friends? Yes. I like you. I'd like to have a friend. I mean, you're a freak and everything, but I like you. I like you, too. I really do, but there are things I can't tell you. Do you understand? Yes. Actually, no, I don't. There are people that want to harm me. Bad peoples. I see. And they won't stop. Right. So for your own safety... Can we still be friends? I don't know. I mean, I don't really know who you are, do I? That's just it. Neither do I. What is it? It's something about me. I know what DNA means, but I don't understand the rest of it. Are you sick? I don't feel sick. What's wrong with you? Nothing's wrong with me. What are you going to do? I'm going to Berlin. I have to meet my father at the house of Wilhelm Grimm. As in "Grimm's Fairytales"? That's right. If you say so. Did I say the wrong thing again? Keep this. To remember me. It's a friendship bracelet. Thank you. Where's Hanna? Wow, you look rough. Do you want some tea? Had some. Who's Hanna? The girl we ate dinner with in Morocco. She's here, or was. She came out with me last night. How did she get here? Is she with her father? No, she came on her own. What? Why don't you let other people have their own style of parenting? He's promoting independence. She's like an orphan. Call me conservative. You're inherently conservative, darling. No, I'm not. I said we'd give her a lift to Lille. We are going to Lille, aren't we? I found breakfast. That's gross. Your mum was so stoned, she'd have eaten anything. We've got him. Picking up now. Do you read me? Do you read me? Do you read me? Bring him to Wiegler. She will ID and interview. Is that what she said? Orders confirmed with her 2 minutes ago. Marissa. Damn her! I feel so grounded in the countryside. The city stifles me, emotionally, creatively, spiritually. Places like this bring us closer to God. God? Well, not in any monotheistic sense. Buddha, Krishna, the god within. Whatever you believe in. What do you believe in, Hanna? Nothing. Everything all right? I think so. I'm not sure if it's true that the baby can hear me, but at night, I sing. I hope she hears me. Was it like this for you, Mama? I think I know what she looks like. I can see her when I close my eyes. I can hear her inside me, moving. Is that silly? I think it's a girl. I hope so. Erik helped me make these tapes. What? He says he will get them to you. For Christ's sakes, Lewis! Hello, Marissa. I heard you were dead. Did your little girl tell you that? Even though he knows all about me... What are you listening to? Self-help. Are you in need of help? It's good to hear you. I didn't imagine we'd have the chance to talk. You don't have her, do you? You're not that good. Oh, Erik, you're such a flirt. Tech's on the way up. You were a good agent, Erik. Was sad to see you go dumb. What did I miss? I couldn't do it anymore, the things we did. I'm sorry? With Johanna? With all of them. With Hanna. So why come back now? Tech guys. I asked you a question, Erik. Erik, are you still there? Move. Get up. Shit! Shit, shit, shit! Hanna, I think we're lost. I'm gonna have to pull over. No. Don't. Can't see the map. Have we stopped? I need to pee. I don't want you going too far right now, love. I think you should stay where you are, Sophie. Hanna, what's going on? Are we in Lille? No, we're not. I don't know where we are. Whatever you do, don't follow me. Promise not to follow me. I promise. Thank you for being my friend. Hanna! Titch! Hanna? Definitely odd. Disconnected. You know, I like to think I have a rapport with kids. You know, I get on with them. You know, sir, it's days like these that I really hate my job. Yeah, I'm sure you do. This is very, very difficult. But sometimes children are bad people, too. Stop crying. I'm not telling you anything. Do you know this boy? - No. - He knows you. Your friend is in a lot of danger. I don't know anything. She said she lived in Leipzig. She went to the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium. Her friends were Rudi and Gunther. She likes tennis, and she has a dog named Trudi. She lied to you. Absolutely. She seemed lost, like she needed taking care of. I've got something to show you. A bit of mothering. This is Hanna's mother. Biological mother. Fifteen years ago, she was shot to death by Hanna's father on a camping trip. Don't you wanna see what's inside? Say please. Please. You like her, don't you? It's okay. I won't tell anyone. She's very pretty. Where is she? You tell me. She in lots of trouble? The worst kind, sweetheart. Some very bad men are looking for her, and I need to find her. I want to protect her. Do you want Hanna to get hurt? No. She's going to Berlin, to Wilhelm Grimm's house, to meet her dad. Hanna! Hanna, Hanna, Hanna. Come. Come. This way. Been waiting for you a long time. What has Erik told you about me? Wilhelm Grimm's house. Stephanstrasse 260. 10559 Berlin, Germany. That's it? He didn't tell you about my magic? What day is it? It's today, my dear. Come. Come. Sit. Sit. You're hungry. Waffles. May I have one? An egg? Of course. You can eat whatever you want, my dear. My shoe. I almost forgot. Present. For me? You will need a fresh photograph, but everything's in order, yes. Why do I need a piece of paper to tell me my name? Not you. Not you, my dear, but everyone else. We need paper and computers so we don't have to ask people their names or look them in the face. You have a good face. You look just like your father. And you walk like him, too. I don't walk like that. Yes, you do. You do, my dear. Did you know my mother, too? But of course. She was a singer. A wonderful singer. Do you sing? Papa... Erik didn't teach me. Oh, you poor child. He has truly limited you from all the wonderful things the world has to offer. No magic. No music. I'll teach you. Is that him? Upstairs with you, my dear. Quickly. The park is closed, boys and girls. Where is Erik? He doesn't know much. Or he's a very good liar. He knew Johanna. Yes, of course. Bits and pieces about the program. What does he know about the girl? He thinks Erik's the father. Everybody thinks Erik's her father. That's precious. Yes? This is Marissa Wiegler. Walt, I didn't... Lewis is dead. You didn't think it would be important to tell us? Why didn't you call it in? "One man, one day operation." We trusted you with a promising agent... Yes, yes, yes, we all loved Lewis. And on top of that, you left a crime scene, Agent. He was shooting through the door, Walt. As of this minute, you are to stand down. No, I'm not standing down. No, I am inches... Your career is on the line. Well, yes. That is fine. No. Listen. Walt. Heizinger block. Hi, boss. So off to Grandmother's house we go. Hanna! Sit down. Are you my father? Sit down, Hanna. Are you my father? Please, sit. Are you? Hanna. Of course I'm your father. I raised you. But Marissa said... Hanna! Don't lie to me. I am your father. I've been with you your whole life. Treated you like you're my own flesh and blood. But I'm not your flesh and blood. - I'm abnormal. - No! Where was I born? Tell me the truth. You were born in a research facility in rural Poland. Galinka. What was the research? They took fertilized embryos and made small changes to them to improve them. To reduce the capacity for fear, for pity, to increase muscle strength, heighten senses. Anything to make a better soldier, the perfect soldier. I recruited your mother at an abortion clinic. I recruited 20 women the same way. There were other children? Yes. When you were two, Marissa Wiegler, she closed the whole program. And all of this research, it was disposed of. Do you understand? I love you, Hanna. You have to know that. Because I'm a freak? No. Because you are my child. We're not finished here. Stop this! Let me go! Stop this! Hanna! Hanna, please! I tried to prepare you for what your life would be. You didn't prepare me for this. Run. Run. Is that all you've got? Huh? Run, little piggy! Why now, Erik? Kids grow up. Mr. Grimm! Mr. Grimm! Mr. Grimm? Hanna! I'm here now, Hanna. Ah. Don't worry, sweetheart. Don't! Don't move any closer! Hanna, I can help you. Please. I don't want to hurt anyone anymore. I just wanna talk. It's over now, Marissa. Let me go. Hanna! Don't walk away from me, young lady! I just missed your heart. Music. A combination of sounds, with a view to beauty of form and expression of emotion.
