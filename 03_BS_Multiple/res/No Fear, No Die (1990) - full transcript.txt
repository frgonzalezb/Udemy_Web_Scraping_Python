CHESTER HIMES - My Life of Absurdity I'm black, and my buddy's the same color. He's West Indian, I'm from Benin. Waiting in this car, I keep remembering some words: "Every human being, whatever his race whatever his country, creed or ideology, ...is capable of just anything." I forget who said it, but it doesn't matter. My name is Dah. Did it go okay? Yeah. Jacelyn here, he's the one that got wind of it. A deal to make big bucks real quick... the kind of dough we need. Our man -- his name's Ardennes has a restaurant at the food markets. He knew Jacelyn's mom in the West Indies. He needs a specialist to run the operation. A specialist -- that's you. Okay? They're as bushed as me. This won't get us far. Here. Carry some cash. Mr. Ardennes, please. Tell him Jocelyn's here. I'm his partner, Dah. Thanks. My son, Michel... Dah, Jocelyn's pal. Hello. It's good to see you. It cost us 120 francs to get in here, but still... what's that between friends? What kept you down in Spain? You're two weeks late. Jocelyn has cockfighting in his genes. I don't know birds from shit, but I do know plenty about business. We make a good team. I see Jocelyn left you holding the bag. That's typical of him. Get me a coffee. So, are my birds in shape? They better be ace fighters considering what they cost me. Sugar. Thanks. Things are tough right now. Times are lousy. I can't go 50-50 with you, or I'd be out of pocket. So here's the deal: I take 200 francs at the door, plus... 30 percent on bets against the house. I'm not taking any cut on private bets. All right? That makes 5 percent for you... and 25 for us. I decide what the stakes will be. We'll make a killing. We just have to trust one another. Find some other suckers, then. I'm not taking risks for chickenshit. And we get a cut on the bar takings -- rememeber? Boy, you drive a hard bargain. How about 10 percent... and 100 francs a day for expences? No go. I need some cash upfront. And I tipped the Spaniard 1,000. Let's go find Jocelyn. Happy reunion time. Ardennes hugs Jocelyn like a son, feeds him a spiel in Creole. Jocelyn clams up. Does it have a name? No-Fear-No-Die. "No-Fear-No-Die." I got to be going. Don't stay here. I've fixed you a pad. It'll be less hassle. That suits me. We don't have money to burn. At time when mom was in trouble... we stayed at grandpa's. We cleaned out the cages every day before school. The cocks slept in the room with us. Sundays, grandpa took me to the pit. My bird had his name embroidered on his bag. He was a Gray -- a real hitter. Ardennes? Ardennes hasn't a clue about cocks. Always hollering in the pit: "Kill him! Kill him!" Once he lost three grand in a day. My mother freaked. She slugged him with the iron. Jeez, these cocks make you guys flip. "Kill, kill!" They get to your brains. Not there! Round the back! I'll bet this guy is really raking it in. Let's move. It's cold. This way, fellers. Come see where it's at. No point in wasting time. I bought the whole place a while ago. Cost me peanuts. That way's boarded up. There was some hassle and the cops had it closed. Looks like a dump, but it works. I gave the disco to my son. I had one like this, only smaller, back in Martinique. I sold it off, about the time you were born, Jocelyn. Michel? Give us a demo of the lightshow, will you? It's no big deal. Acres and acres of sugar cane! A moving sight, huh? Cocks, I dream about 'em. Went every day in Martinique. Except Fridays. That was rest-day. Pont-Vert, La Choco, St-Marie, Le Lorrain... I knew all the pits, even the ones in the backwoods. You know? Once you've had a taste of it, you can't give it up. If you're not a born gambler, you can't understand. It has you hooked. See, Jocelyn, Same as love... you never know why. This is going to be the way in for the customers. Pretty neat, I reckon. And now... the Gates of Hell. Yeah, it needs fixing up. This is the pit. You'll like it. All right for you? It's a closet. It was wasted space. Where's the bar going? I haven't decided. He hasn't decided. So, is this okay? No it isn't. The whole thing sucks. I knew it would. And that carpet is crap. You're here for the money. I just knew it. There's stacks to be had. Isn't my Toni a beauty? I'll show you around. This is Fran?ois, my cook. We're old buddies. He's been working 10 or 15 years for me. I even pay his social security now! Jocelyn, here's a guy from your neck of the woods, "Riv?re Sal?e." You've seen everything... ...laundry-room... If you need anything, just ask. I fixed up the cages. Hope they're OK. This way! Mind your heads. Here you can work in peace. The cocks' room. A good warm place for them. This is your pad. No shower. Use the staff shower out there. You were less fussy when you were a kid! Your mom had to wash you by force! I got something for Fran?ois! Still go around the back! How's things? We're still here. I got Marlboros, okay? Great, they'll do fine. Hungry? No thanks. Not at the price he's charging. I prefer our own chow. The boss has flipped his lid! Fran?ois! Fix me a coffee. I passed by the pharmacy. It's freezing here. Put on a sweater. The gas is empty. It's ready, let's eat. Did you get everything? It's all there: vitamins B6, B12... even the iron pills you wanted. This is a kind of throat spray. There's antiseptics, too. It's all written in German. You sure it's right? I don't want to poison them. Gimme a rest. It's the same stuff, just a different brand name. I'm digging in, I'm hungry. Jocelyn keeps his skills to himself. The way he talks, cock training's like a ritual. It follows strict rules. Break them, and you'll lose... or worse. His day. starts at 7 a.m., same as the birds. The training begins. That's 98 francs. I'll owe you the change. It's great working here. The food's so fresh. Honest, 98 francs. He owes me the change. He drives us nuts. That same old tape all day! It's good for the cocks... It charges them up! Can't you turn that thing down? It's been screeching for hours! Food's my department. I fix their meals twice a day. He's always checking to see that I don't overfeed them or goof up the doses. Men, cocks... Same thing. Careful, fellers... Did you make sure all the merchandise is here? Get outta here! Sometimes I go to the restaurant for a beer and see what's going down. Excuse me... You're always uptight. Toni's a strange chick. Sometimes she pays us a visit to watch the roosters. Your mom again? She hates us. I don't know what intrigues her more: us or the birds. Jocelyn told her to stay away from them. She's a bad influence. She loves to bug you. A female's a female. It's hormonal. Jocelyn has a theory about it. Females dictate male behavior. They're a no-no. An uncaged hen gives the cocks bad vibes. It bothers them. Makes them jumpy or flabby. We keep away, too. Watch your cigarette ash! This rug cost a fortune. Put that here. Gonna give us a hand? We do what was agreed. - Your No-Fear-No-Die's a beauty! - Hands off! He's a cock of the walk! A hitter, huh? Clipped, they look skinny. Enjoy your meal. Thanks. The first fight's tomorrow. He's fasting today, like his birds. All here? So let's begin. Don't bring no more flabby hens in here! What did he want? I dunno. Your bird pulled a trick! A goddamn trick! The Calagay weighs in at 3 lbs 5 oz. Now for the champ. 3 lbs 14 oz. Bets of 1,000 on numbers 2 and 10. 2 and 10 at 1,000 Number 3. Red-and-black against the Calagay. No-Fear-No-Die gets special care. Jocelyn rubs him with spittle. Here he is. This cock wearing the red tag's the contender. He could spring a few surprises. The green tag is the champ. Isn't he a beauty? Magnificent. Second fight, stakes set at 3,000. The critters move too fast but when your money's on a bird, it looks quite different. You start yelling too... like at crap dice. Only there's often dead meat at the end. You don't mind that. It gives you a kick. Tonight's take looks good. Do you know Toni, my wife? Good evening. Enjoy the slaughter? Not too tired, Fran?ois? This rooster's good. Bullshit. It tastes just like chicken. Rooster meat's like game or fish. True fish-eaters eat the fishbones, too. Rooster is the same. It gives a strong-tasting meat. It deserves to be savored. To enjoy it properly, you have to eat it right. Everything okay, Dah? They took the bait. Saturday's a sellout. Aren't you eating? Ah, Jocelyn... Your mother was so lovely. She really was a beauty. Beauty on earth. Sometimes I'd just sit and stare at her. I'd have done handstands across the island for her. You couldn't pin her down. At times, she used to sulk all day long... and then... there she was. She screwed me up. She screwed me up... just by looking at me. You got her goddam eyes. Her eyes! That's all we hear about. You told my mom you couldn't wait to dump us. I remember that. Don't worry, folks. I don't ask for love. That's lucky. What's the matter? We got to split. Not till we get the money. You scared me. Changed your brand? No, I got them for you. You tuck them in, now? Your cock's had it. No-Fear-No-Die's blinded. He's bleeding bad. Hey, I'm short 20,000 francs. All the birds are there. Sneaked up your price? No, we had to come a long way! Pay him. I'm out of cash. You still owe me money for the car! Where d'you spend it? Okay, so long. New blood... Ardennes thinks it's easy to raise winners. Jocelyn's losing heart. He clams up for hours on end. Quit it! You're tripping out. Cut it out. No win. A coffee, please. Love is a job. It gets to be like work. I can get girls when I want to, but... right now I want to be alone. Times I get plenty, times I can do without. I can't explain it... You got to control it. I'm not just a dick. I need to do what I have to do. That's enough for me. He says he wants Toni. Says he's just got to have her. It dates from too far back. Looking for me? What's this? There's a chunk missing. Recession, pal. You saw, tonight was dead. That ain't my job. Shake up your advertising. Our work hasn't changed. Who buys the cocks? You know what they cost? Plus I pay overheads: water, heating... I tell you what the problem is. Jocelyn! I'm mainly talking about you. The act's screwed up. Folks want a real show, like in Mexico or Puerto Rico. Those guys are smart! No messing around with your dumb little horn spurs. Your fads don't make money. Their birds wear real knives. It's fast. Exciting! I know a guy in the business, up North. He makes steel spurs. That'll upgrade the show. It's too dumb, really! We got everything else! Michel, call the Gypsies. They're really slick. We aren't under any contract. I'm here because it suits me. Stick to the agreement, guys. Mexican razor blades, I don't give a shit. How about you? I can't be bothered anymore. Like mother, like son: good in bed but born to lose. I knew her before you existed. If you weren't so black, you might have some of my blood in you. Huh, son? Don't do it, bro. I need air. Money! Money! I got enough. I'm splitting. Don't act like you forgot. You owe stacks more than you got. This ain't gonna last forever. It won't last forever! Toni... Toni... Jocelyn! I don't believe this! Shit, Jocelyn! Help me, at least. Got any spare carrots or bananas? The cocks are starving. Look in the pantry. Say... Your buddy, he's hitting the booze too hard. You doing OK? Still hanging in, bro. We're locked in! I wanted to keep you. How about a quiet Sunday in with momma-poppa? Take a look at this. Forget it, dad! It's for Jocelyn. Michel got the new spurs. We'll pack 'em in tonight. Pipo's bringing his tribe of Gypsies. See? What's wrong with Jocelyn? Is he sick? He already told you what he thinks. He says steel spurs carve up the birds. He says! He says bullshit! You West Indians are assholes! Good only to sweep up crap! You deserve to get screwed over by whites. I'm an easy-going guy, okay? We'll do your Gypsy jamboree, no problem. Okay so far? Then you and me settle up. You keep the cocks, we go. I'll set the cops on you. Go ahead, try it! They'll love to hear about your racket with the army. Jocelyn! Hello. Good evening. Have you seen Jocelyn? Good evening. I haven't seen him for a long time. Not for a long time. Thank you. Know where he is? I don't know. What's the matter? Don't want to talk? Ignore his bullshit. We'll split. But I want the money. Beat it, Dah. Lay off the booze, for Chrissakes. Get the fuck out! Where are you going? Where're you going? You don't even know! You're the Prince, is that it? I'm sick of being your flunkey, sweeping your shit! Come on! We knew what to expect, didn't we? So finish the job or I'll bust your face! Then you can go get lost. Get on! You goddam smartass! The subway's full of jerks like you without guys like me to help them. Wise up! The show's this way! Quiet, please! Quiet please, ladies and gentlemen. Your attention, please. I just heard an interesting suggestion: Pipo wants to pit his bird against the chamption White. If nobody minds, we'll change tonight's program. Are you leaving? Yes. We're going. Is that... the one called Toni? Take me with you. 20,000 on the white champ! 15,000 on the Gypsy's bird! We never make love now. What must I do -- dye my dick? Tell me... are you leaving? 5,000 on the Gypsy. A threesome, with Doudou. So, Doudou? Three of you on this? -Where's Michel? -I don't know. Twenty thousand on the White. Don't blow that bread just to hurt me. It'll bring me luck. Shut up! You pack of dogs! Ever see one like this? Did anyone see a cock like this? Vermin... Pack of dogs! Leave me alone! Tell your mothers to suck this one! Look... Ever seen a cock like this? Take a good look. See him? You pigs. Okay, so the warm-up act is over. Let's start the fight. Gypsy cock is favorite. Put up your birds. I'll rip your balls. I'll chew up your hen. You're winning. Nothing's happened, nothing. The fight goes on. 8,000 on the White! White 8,000! Come on, put up your hen! Cut it out, Jocelyn! Hold the kid or I'll kill him! Kid... I don't like those eyes. They're empty. They'll never show me your home. From the porch, under the breadfruit tree. I see rolling waves of banana plants. It's all green and cool. Down below, there's a brook. In the shade, by the big table, there are coconuts and a machete. They're so good, after a morning's work. They're heavy and full of milk. The cocks are crowing, but I can't see them. Your mother's there, doing a little dance to her Stevie Wonder tape. She looks calm. She cooked you some rice and beans. She lives alone now. Your brothers and sisters help her out. She's happy without a husband. She scolds you when you say you're going to France. "What'll you do there, son?" Your grandpa's shack is right nearby. He also lives on his own. Your mother brings him his meals. He's hard to please. He lives among his cocks. They're all he has now. You okay? Yeah. No animal was hurt or mistreated during the making of this film.
