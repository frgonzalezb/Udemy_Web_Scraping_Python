MADELINE: Oh, my God. You scared us. DAWN: Sorry, your door is open. I just wanted to be the first to welcome you. There, Birds of Paradise. I picked them myself. Oh, how sweet. I'm Madeline. This is my husband. It still feels so weird to say that. PARKER: We just got married. DAWN: Oh, my God. That's great. Congrats. - I'm Parker. - MADELINE: Who is this - little guy? - That's Rambo. PARKER: Rambo? Like Sylvester Stallone, right? What? No. Like the French poet. Are you a photographer? I saw your equipment. PARKER: That's just a hobby. Well, if you ever need a model... - Make yourself at home. - Uh, Parker's a writer, actually. He's on the best-sellers list. PARKER: Was. For nonfiction. DAWN: Oh, all right. What's the book? It's called Back to Normal. It's a story about a war vet with PTSD coming home. I'm a writer, too. I have a blog. I love this house. It is so gorgeous. You know, if you ever need any help decorating, I have an incredible eye. I've designed, like, - all my friends' houses. - MADELINE: Oh. That's so sweet. My mom is a decorator, actually. She's gonna be flying in from Seattle - in a little bit, so. - Uh-hmm. - We're good. - DAWN: Do you guys have kids? - No, God, no. - Not yet. DAWN: Well, I'm really good at babysitting, and I'm practically a full-time babysitter when Kristoff is in town, because his whole band - is a bunch of babies. - PARKER: Oh, wow. So we have rock stars living next door. Oh, hardly. They tour in a Dodge van with carpeting on the ceiling, but I am in their latest music video, and I designed all the costumes, so you should really check it out. Oh, you know, uh, that's funny, because Madeline's a costume designer. DAWN: What? That's crazy. We have so much in common. Do you play? Uh, it came with the house, actually. I write music. [Madeline laughs] Oh, my God. - PARKER: She does it all. - DAWN: Yeah. - PARKER: A real triple-threat. - DAWN: Yeah. I write lyrics and I sing. I don't play any instruments or anything, but I do have some demos on my blog. And you can read my writing there, too. - Dawnoftime... - Great. Com. We will definitely check that out. Do you think it's haunted? I think all houses are haunted... Madeline is a little sensitive... to some extent. About the H-word. DAWN: Oh, why? It can be a good thing. Ghosts can be friendly, too, you know. Plus, I am very connected to the spirit world, - and this place. - Uh-hmm. Of course she is. There's some really good energy. Have you guys met Dorothy, yet? - Dorothy? - Dorothy? DAWN: Yeah, she runs like the Historical Society or something. She knows everything about these old houses. Well, we will have to meet her. Uh, Dawn, um, not to be rude, but we have a lot of unpacking to do. Yeah. But thank you so much for stopping by. And thank you for the beautiful flowers. Oh, my God. You guys, I'm so excited that you're here. - Uh-huh. - Seriously, I am starved for... - Oh. - Human connection, so we will have to have a drink to celebrate you -she's friendly. Bye. Bye. She is not modeling for you. [phone rings] [instrumental music playing] Dessert. - Thank you. - Uh-hmm. You know, I took lessons as a kid. Were you any good? MADELINE: Oh, it broke my mother's heart when she realized I had no talent. Oh. [piano playing] MADELINE: My dad used to say the piano ain't got no wrong notes. - That's Monk. - What? That's Thelonious Monk. He said that. Well, they were both wrong. [piano playing] The faster her fingers flew over the keys, - the more he marveled. - Is that Monk, too? No, that's Flaubert, from Madame Bovary. Well, did Madame Bovary play this? [Madeline chuckles] [piano playing] [footsteps] [slow relaxing music playing] [rat squeaking] [glass shatters] Shit. Ah. Jesus. PARKER: You got to see this. MADELINE: What is it? - It was in the attic. - Whoa. - Oh, my gosh. - You know what this is? Did they leave this here? This is a plate camera. These things are worth a fortune. I mean, this could be the original owner's. This is amazing. Do you think it still works? We'll find out. - By the way... - Yeah. We have squatters. - What? - Rats. MADELINE: What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. [vintage music playing] ROB: Hey, Parker. It's Rob. Uh, I'm just calling to check with you how the writing's going. Give me a call. FRIDA: Hi, Parker. This is a Frida Richmond. I haven't heard from you in a while. Give me a call when you get a chance. Thank you. [foreboding music playing] [water splashing] [brooding music playing] Jesus Christ. Hmm. [Madeline inhales deeply] You said you quit. What? You smell like smoke. You know I need your sperm nicotine-free, right? It's no secret, Parker. We've been married a month. And now you're gonna be baby-crazy? I'm not baby-crazy just because I want kids. Kids? Kids? How much kids? How many of these things do you want? Start with one, and see how it goes. [foreboding music playing] [thud] [whimsical music playing] PARKER: [chills] [panting] [dark music playing] [child chuckles] MADELINE: God. I wonder who she was. PARKER: Do you realize we are the first people to see this, ever, in the history of the universe. I mean, this thing has to be a hundred years old. Older. I mean, look at the dress. That's the turn-of-the-century. - I have one just like it. - PARKER: Uh-hmm. [phone rings] Rob. ROB: They paid you in advance. Apparently, it was more like milk money. - [dog barks] - ROB: And you are behind. Hey, look, they want something. Can you give them something? Rob, I'm at the mercy of a... Of a very unreliable subject who keeps blowing me off. ROB: Well, maybe this guy is not the right guy. There is no other guy. Look, I'll get you something soon. Trust me. ROB: Look, I'm not gonna lie, they are concerned... [brooding music playing] MADELINE: Where are you off to? I'm meeting my guy. So it's finally happening. PARKER: Meeting's out of this... At this, uh, donut shop in, uh, MacArthur Park. He calls it his office. You gonna be okay? You know I'm a little freaked out. Oh, come on. Just take an edible or drink something to relax. - I'll see you soon. - Good luck. - Thank you. - I love you. I love you, too. [door closes] [sinister music playing] [car revving] PARKER: Ah. [grunts] [jazz music playing] - MAN: Come on. - [indistinct chatter] DAVEY: Okay. Easy. The Carole King, Burt Bacharach, or Nyro, Marvin Hamlisch, Jimmy Webb. It's, uh, Dylan, Springsteen, that's a very anemic list that you have there. Well, you know... Yeah, I'm surprised you left yourself off of it. - Ah. - [Parker chuckles] He's that humble. - You got it all... - What about The Beatles? [laughs] Who are you? I thought you were having a party. No, no, no. No, this is, uh, it's a little housewarming thing. It's just a couple of friends. Um, this is Dawn, she's... um, she lives next door. She's, uh, kind of the neighborhood welcoming committee. - Uh-hmm. Okay. - This is Rob, he's my agent. I'm off the clock, just Rob. - [laughs] - Hi, Just Rob. Just Rob. That's Davey. Davey Burt, the famous songwriter. - That's me. - DAWN: Yeah. Your song Remember When is one of my favorite songs ever. Come on, kid. You don't know Remember When. - No, I'm serious. - How old are you? - Very rude. - How old are you? JANINE: Girl, I can't over this house. How many bedrooms? Three bedrooms. One of them is Parker's office, though, and the other one is a guest room. You mean the nursery? - We'll see. - [laughs] Well, girl, you got to do it before you're 40. Jesus. Are you a fertility expert? All I'm saying is now you can scrap your backup plan. I mean, what are you gonna do with all those eggs you froze? - Make a $14,000 omelet? - [laughter] God, he's playing. - Oh, let's go see. - Come on. Yeah. DAWN: ♪ Autumn leaves around ♪ ♪ It's the silhouettes along the sidewalk of - ♪ DAVEY: Great. DAWN: ♪ Remember when the moon ♪ ♪ I prayed ♪ ♪ Chalked it up to the right time ♪ ♪ And played ♪ Seriously? DAWN: ♪ It was the last time I saw your face ♪ ♪ It was the last time I saw your face ♪ [instrumental music playing] DAVEY: They gave you a big advance on the book. - How's it going? - Slow start. This move has been sucking all the life out of me. Hmm. But I finally met with my subject. Cool. And, man, his stories are amazing. Where do you find these guys? It's like you're a... You're a magnet for seriously damaged individuals. Well, the stories that have to be told by someone. Boys, boys, boys. Hey. - What a fun night. - You leaving? Yeah. Got to go. Got to go walk Rambo. But seriously, incredible party. - Iconic. - Hmm. - And you... - Hey. What a freaking legend. - You're the legend. You killed it. You killed it on that piano. Uh-hmm. [sighs] Ooh. Ooh. And by the way, that guy, Rob, your agent, I think he's gonna sign me. - Oh. - So thanks. - Night. - Let's do this again. Sooner than later. It's a nice neighborhood. [Parker chuckles] Who was that? What? Oh. Nothing. Nothing. Why do you look like you just shit your pants? Hey. Can I tell you something? Yeah, of course. I know that you were friends with Maddy before me but I feel like we've gotten pretty close. DAVEY: I mean, you're, like, my only friend now. Go. Give it. All right. [chuckles] There's... uh, [sighs] all right. So before Maddy, there was this woman. DAVEY: Uh-hmm. It didn't last long, just a few dates, but it did not end well. - DAVEY: Hmm, does it ever? - No, I'm serious. This was really, really bad. I mean, it started with phone calls and then... And then nonstop texting, and so I changed my number, right? DAVEY: Uh-hmm. But she finds a way around that. And then one night, I see her sitting outside of my apartment in her car just waiting. - DAVEY: No. - Yeah. So, uh, I mean, I call the cops. DAVEY: Uh-hmm. But by the time they get there, she's gone. And this keeps happening every night for weeks and the cops start thinking that I'm nuts. - [Davey chuckles] - Yeah. But one night, I come home... and she's there in my apartment, hiding under my bed. DAVEY: Jesus Christ. So, yeah, they finally lock her up on the 5150. - Do you know what that is? - DAVEY: No. It's where they can keep you at a psych ward for 72 hours. DAVEY: Ah. They end up keeping her for a month. - DAVEY: Fuck. - Yeah. So I got a restraining order and last I heard, um, she had moved away some place. Look, you cannot mention this to Janine, please? - So Maddy doesn't know? - No, she knows about her. She just doesn't know that I... That what? I think she might be back. Oh, I love your neighbor. She's, uh, really talented. Jesus Christ. It's like being in a beating heart. PARKER: That's the idea. Yeah. So, uh, look, uh, I know this isn't the time or the place and you already got a wife, so you don't need malice in your house. Rob. This is the best thing I've ever written. Just give me a week. [knocks on door] DAVEY: Hey, I want a tour! I got to go anyways. All right. I'll call you. - Okay. - All right. DAVEY: This is the money shot. PARKER: It's pretty good, right? DAVEY: Man, I'd love to get Janine up here. PARKER: I don't think we're -for live sex shows, but you can work on... ow! This house, things just keeps falling apart. DAVEY: Shit, man. There's something in there. - Hmm. - PARKER: Careful. There's black widows around here. Ah! Shit! - Ah! - You're an idiot. [chuckles] Got ya. No, for real, man, there was a box in here. What? [Davey grunts] What the? We keep finding all these weird stuff in this house. What is it? Letters, man. There's like fucking 50 of them in here, all to William. "My dear sweet William. A mere minute has passed since you kissed me good night and the scent of bay rum fills my nostrils and clouds my mind." Juicy stuff. Like the Victorian Penthouse forum. Wait a minute. Who's William? The guy who built this house, his name was William Woodruff. - What? - JANINE: Okay. Well, keep reading. Um, okay. "You erupt a passion in me that rivals Vesuvius. Is that a metaphor for an orgasm? - DAVEY: I love them. - JANINE: Uh-hmm. [chuckles] MADELINE: "Though our lives are oceans apart, I'm drawn to you like a ship to a lighthouse. As if our souls are destined to unite. Oh, William, I need not food nor water if I can just taste your lips again. Until then, your thirsty flower, Rebecca." JANINE: That was pretty deep. - DAVEY: Hmm. - Hmm. - Way to go, William. - [laughs] They're love letters. You never wrote me any love letters. And you know what? Dick pics don't count. Oh, for William? Oh, shit. I forgot your housewarming gift. - Ay, you didn't get a us gift? - I did. PARKER: Stick that on. JANINE: I'm really - to be in this house... - PARKER: It's working. - DAVEY: Oh, no. It's good. Try... where is the... I think it's this. Oh. MADELINE: How much do you think this thing is - [phonograph scratching] It's on. MAN: In the shell of the pines, sung by Artemis - in his own record. [vintage music playing] MADELINE: [sighs] I'm up for a job. Oh, yeah? Mercedes commercial. Oh. Money's good, but it's creative death. Creativity is overrated. [Madeline laughs] Take your money and run. MADELINE: I think we should read one per night. Maybe like little cliffhangers, like those novels written in letters, what are they called? Epistolary. Ugh. I can't wait to show my mom. She's gonna be so excited. I mean, can you believe we found these? How cool. How long ago would they have been written? Oh, this would make a great podcast. I can totally imagine it on NPR. What do you think? [dark music playing] Hello? What? What are you doing? What's wrong? Nothing. I'm, uh, gonna lock up. Okay. [brooding music playing] [light switch clicks] [door slams shut] [swing creaking] - And you think I'm paranoid? - [chuckles] I always sleep with a baseball bat next to the bed. - Uh-huh. - It's a... yeah, force of habit. - [Madeline chuckles] - What? I've got a meeting early in the morning. - Okay. - I'm gonna get some sleep. Okay. [chuckles] I love you. I love you, too. [sinister music playing] MADELINE: "My dear William, love is like a wave lapping at the shore. It hits the sand only to roll back into the sea. But when it finds another's love, the waters meet and mix, and become one deep ocean. And if I cut open a vein, you would flow out. In my heart, I know you feel the same. May the walls that keep us apart, crumble. Your floating flower, Rebecca." [uplifting music playing] [Parker claps] - [Madeline laughs] - Back a little bit. Right there. Perfect. [laughs] Oh, my God. That corset really does a number on your back. Hmm, it feels good. Hey, what do you think she means "the walls that keep us apart?" Walls of society? Um, I mean, they're Victorian. It wasn't easy to date back then. I think it's a metaphor. I think she means something else. - Hey, why did you stop? - [swing creaking] [sinister music playing] - Call 911. - What? PARKER: Maddy, just do it! Call 911! - Call 911! - What? Stay there! [sci-fi music playing] [phone line ringing] DISPATCHER: 911, what's your emergency, please? Uh, we have a swing out back, she was sitting on that, - and then she disappeared. - COP 1: Disappeared? - Like a ghost? - No. What? No. Uh, I just lost sight of her. And you called 911 for... He had a stalker. What? It was a year ago. Okay. He has a restraining order. COP 1: Was it her? I don't know. I couldn't see her face. Did you see her? You have the restraining order? I do. Yes. It's in my office. COP 1: Hang on. If you can't ID her, it's no use. What's her name? Gina Santorelli. COP 1: Tell you what. We'll cruise around, check the neighborhood. That's all we can do. Probably a drunk girl from the bars. [car starting] [honks] - Was it her? - I don't know. I feel sick. I'm sorry. How could you not know she was crazy? [dark music playing] [indistinct chatter] [dark music continues] PARKER: You know how PTSD works? It's a slow cooker. It's like a tumor. It festers inside of you for months, sometimes years. Sometimes you don't even notice it. But when you finally do, it's just too late. It's taken root and it eats you alive. I thought I could leave that all behind. And that this could be a fresh start. It is. It is. For both of us. You think I don't have my fair share of trauma? Try being a Black woman in this world. [chuckles] I've been screwed and gaslit so many times I could light up the street. PARKER: [chuckles] MADELINE: But we're together now. Nothing's gonna change that. [keyboard clicking] [sinister music playing] [sinister music continues] [thunder rumbling] [grunts] [keyboard clicking] [door creaking] [thunder rumbling] [keyboard clicking] [gramophone playing] [thunder rumbling] [gramophone playing] [thunder rumbling] [rousing music] [door creaking] [sinister music playing] [thunder rumbling] [grunting] [sinister music continues] MADELINE: Parker? Are you down there? - Can you come to bed? - [window slams] MADELINE: The storm is freaking me out. Please? I'll be right up. [pensive music playing] - [car door slams] - PARKER: The usual. Thanks. [keyboard clicking] PARKER: Rob, I was just gonna call you. ROB: Please tell me you have something. PARKER: My guy is finally coming through. I have the first 30 pages. ROB: Oh, thank fucking God. When can you get them to me? I'll call you later, all right? ROB: I can make double. PARKER: All right. See ya. Bye. FRIDA: Hi, Parker. This is Frida Richmond again. I don't know if you're out-of-town or what. But I really do need to speak to you. Call me. Thank you. JANINE: Dear William by sheer fate of serendipity, I saw you today. As I bought oranges from the farmers on Bunker Hill, I spotted your high head above the crowd. Imagine my surprise to see you back from San Francisco. In my excitement, I nearly screamed out your name, and how scandalous that I wore the very dress you bought me with the lovely embroidery. It's no wonder you enjoy clothing me when faced with her matronly form. Poor dear, child-rearing has taken its toll. But I am all yours, William, even if you are only half mine. Your patient flower Rebecca. You guys. William is having an affair. The walls that keep us apart. Come on. That is his wife, his child. Rebecca, mistress. JANINE: Okay. First of all, - William is a player. - [chuckles] DAVEY: This isn't gonna end well. She's wearing the dress that he bought her who just happens to see him? They saw each other at a market. He doesn't write her back. He doesn't tell her - he's in town? - No, no. I'm with Davey. I'm with Davey. - She's a stalker. - I think that's your modern - cynicism you're putting on it. - It's not cynicism, man. - This is not a coincidence. - He could write her. He could tell her that he doesn't wanna be with her. He's not. So it seems like he's egging her on. Parker's right. She's clearly young and vulnerable. He should communicate. Okay. Guys, guys, I hate to break it to you, but our dear, sweet Rebecca is bat-shit crazy. - Uh-huh. - I got to take a leak. Oh, me too. - I'll go upstairs. - No, no. Hey, I got it. Look, I need the exercise. She's crazy. [chuckles] I mean, this shit's crazy. Literally. I mean, she got nice penmanship. [chuckles] JANINE: Oh, God. I need a drink. [toilet flushes] Hello? - [tense music playing] - [grunts] [tense music continues] - [screaming] - JANINE: Oh, my God, Davey. - PARKER: Oh, my God. - Parker, - PARKER: What happened? - Call an ambulance. JANINE: Call 911. Call 911. Davey. - Davey, wake up! - MADELINE: Janine, no, no, no. JANINE: Oh, my God. I don't know if he's breathing. MADELINE: Okay. He's still breathing. - It's gonna be okay. - JANINE: Davey, wake up! DISPATCHER: 911, what's your emergency? - JANINE: Davey! - Okay. Well, keep us updated, okay? Okay. Good night. [sighs] Hmm. Davey's still in the hospital. They're keeping him overnight. PARKER: Is he gonna be okay? Take one of these. - Oh, what is this? - An Ambien. It'll help you sleep, okay? - There you go. - Hmm. [sighs] Those stairs are treacherous. We'll do something about that. Okay. I love you. I love you.

I'm not crazy. - [moaning] - [panting] [sinister music continues] This can't be real. - [panting] - [moaning] This can't be... - This can't be real. - [moaning] - [moaning] - [panting] [panting] DAVEY: I'm starving. Will you make me a sandwich? JANINE: What do I look like a maid? I'll help you. - Whatever. [chuckles] - We'll make the man a sandwich. He's bruised and grumpy, so... I love you. Man, you scared the hell out of us. [grunts] PROFESSOR RANKIN: Mankind is waiting for the Messiah, but for the German, the Messiah is not the Prince of Peace. Look, man, I know I'm not the most credible witness right now, but fuck I swear to God, something... PROFESSOR RANKIN: Another Hitler. Hit me. PARKER: Davey, I mean you just took a really bad fall. I did not fall on my own. I think she was in your house. - PARKER: Who? - What do you mean who? Your stalker. You need... you need to go back there right now. You need... you need to check everything top, top to bottom. Goddamn it, man. Fuck it. I hope it's... I hope it's not true, but here. - PARKER: Uh-hmm. - DAVEY: Get this. Help me. Give me the box. Oh. - What the hell is that? - It's a .9 millimeter. - Take it. - No. No, no, no, - I'm not taking a gun. - What if I'm right? What if there was someone in your house? What if there's still somebody in your house? - You got to go look. - [sighs] Okay. Look, man, Janine said I have to stay awake for 24 hours. That's a perfect excuse for Maddy to stay here. Protect your family. REBECCA: Dear William, last night I stood outside your house. A lamp burned in your study, and I knew you were awake. I could have rung your bell, my fingers just inches from it. MADELINE: You would have answered the door, your wife being fast asleep. You would have seen my face, and I yours. REBECCA: And you would've been unpardonably furious with me. MADELINE: In that tempestuous moment I could've sabotaged all that is dear to me for the mere sake of having your attention for a moment. Why do you not respond? My desperation is your making... Rebecca. It's just so sad. [brooding music playing] - DAWN: Hi. - Hi. DAWN: I saw your lights were on. I thought you were maybe - having another party, are you? - No. DAWN: Were you doing anything fun? I mean I'm a little... A little busy right now. DAWN: Listen, my plans fell through and I cannot find my corkscrew and I hate to drink alone. Is there any chance you wanna just have a drink with me? I will seriously wither away and die in my apartment. Like, I will be done tomorrow if you don't hang out with me. I need to hang out with someone. - Okay. Come on in. - DAWN: Okay. - Thanks. - [crickets chirping] Madeline's staying with some friends tonight. - Oh. - I was just gonna do some work. Oh, do you want me to open that? Only if you're gonna drink it. All right. I could use something stiffer. I would love something stiff. Oops, that didn't sound right. [chuckles] I will have whatever you're having. - PARKER: Bourbon okay? - Bourbon's beautiful. Thanks. Here's looking at you, kid. - [glass clinks] - That's from Casablanca. It's an old movie. Do you ever wonder what it will be like to, like, live in black and white? I think about it all the time. It's so much more glamorous. I love your records. You should put one on. SINGER: ♪ I still remember ♪ Where did you get the furniture? Oh, I don't know, wherever. I read your book. You did? Wow. I cried. It was heartbreaking, beautiful. Thank you. Um, so why is it a bad time? - [chuckles] - What? DAWN: You said it was a bad time, why? Oh, it's a long story. You can tell me anything, you know. I can keep a secret. Do you ever wonder where you went wrong in life? Like, if you could go back to that moment where you went off the rails and just fix it? If I had to live my whole life over again, I'd make all the same mistakes only sooner, Tallulah Bankhead said that. She's an actress. So, what's your moment? I was 12, hanging out with some friends, throwing eggs at cars from an overpass down to the freeway. And this kid, Derrick Bush, he picks up this big rock and he dares me to throw it off. And I said no. But he had bought my burger that day and he said if I did it then I didn't have to pay him back. So I did. It went through a windshield and the guy skid off the side of the road and into a tree. I can still remember that sound. It was like a plane crash, like a bomb going off. And that was it. And we, um... we ran away and we never spoke about it ever again... until now. Kids do stupid shit. It's the way with kids. Was the guy okay? So, yeah, if I could go back, I would pay for my own lunch. If I could go back, I would just give that little boy a hug. I bet that's all he needed. [chuckles] I have to tell you something, I'm not... very good with temptation. DAWN: Neither am I. I'll be right back. Okay. [drawer closes] [water gushing] [switch click] [metal clinking] Hello? Parker? Hey. What are you doing here? - [thuds] - [groans] - [thudding] - [Dawn groans] You see, I've never been good with temptation because I've never been good with women, which is why... Dawn? Hello? Dawn? [sinister music playing] [gasps] [cries] No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. [panting] Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. Oh, no. Oh, fuck, fuck. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [dial tone beeping] [phone rings] DISPATCHER: 911, what's your emergency? [retches] [fire crackling] [stairs creaking] [eerie music playing] You've ruined my life. Dear, sweet Parker. I am your life.

[footsteps] [Madeline screams] [sobs] What is this? She was in our house, Parker. [sobs] Oh, no. [footsteps] MADELINE: No! [sobs] I can't live like this. You said she was gone. She's in our fucking house. Call the police. I want her arrested. You started this. You have to fucking stop it! Call the police, Parker! [car horn honking] [gasps] Oh, my God. It's gorgeous. Just leave them right here. Oh! Honey. Hey, Mom. Hello, Parker. Give me a hug. Darling. [gasps] You guys, look at it. I was sandwiched between these two big goons. Of course, it was big as Volkswagens. And they were spreading like they were giving birth. And then... oh, God! The taxi smelled like a slaughterhouse and I had my head outside like a Saint Bernard. Oh, wonderful. [gasps] It's like you guys have been living here for years. Oh, I have so many ideas. You know, I wanna go to every antique shop and flea market in town. I mean, I think we should go easy on the Victorian stuff and sort of mix in some mid-century... you know. We don't want the house to look like a museum, or haunted, or worse, like some old maid lives here with her cats. Where's the bathroom? MADELINE: Oh, it's just through, just through there. Huh. Oh! The piano. Everybody should have a piano in their house even if you play like Maddy. You never know, Herbie Hancock could come over for dinner. PARKER: I'm gonna put your bags upstairs. EVELYN: Oh. Thank you, Parker. I can't believe I forgot she was coming. She can't know about any of this. - Maddy. - As soon as we leave... - Maddy, we don't know... - call the fucking police. - We don't know if it was her. - And have her arrested. - The door was open. - Or to press charges. - It could have been anyone. - We know who... You know damn well who it was. [machine whirring] EVELYN: You know, I was thinking, we should hit the flea market on Melrose. You know the one by the high school? - Uh-huh. - Is it Melrose? Yeah. Yeah. - We can do that. - [engine starts] EVELYN: Because I think we've missed the Rose Bowl. I think that's only in the morning. MADELINE: Yeah. [car revving] [brooding music playing] EVELYN: Licorice. Did you know that licorice can kill you? Did you know that? It's deadly. It can give you heart failure. Parker, don't eat licorice. Oh, Parker's got enough bad habits. You're not still smoking, are you? He quit. Right, honey? How's your book coming, Parker? Hmm. Good. - Yeah, it's coming along. - Hmm. You're not gonna write something depressing, are you? I mean, why don't you write something uplifting? You'll probably get paid more. - MADELINE: Mom? - [laughs] She's probably right, but... it's like they say, write what you know. Do you know how hard it is to get published, Mom? Parker's on the bestseller's list. I know. I read it. It was wonderful. It was depressing as hell. Parker does his interviews at a donut shop. - Really? - [Madeline laughs] It costs me an egg and cheese sandwich and a chocolate old-fashioned, but... his stories are spectacular. And he's not depressed or depressing. He's... In fact, he's funny and clever. And he lives in a tent under the freeway and he dumpster-dives for his food. But he still manages to find beauty and humor in life. Uplifting enough for you? REBECCA: William... your wife and daughter left earlier than usual this morning, nearly discovered me. Look how the little one bares your countenance. Do you stay at the office so late because you dread returning to your wife's side? Is the thought of sharing a bed with that frump so repugnant that you remain in your study till dawn? "We too shared a bed together, William. And as I now carry the burden of our imprudence, the burden that will one day also bare your countenance. You must know that I cannot endure this alone. Rebecca. My God, she's pregnant." MADELINE: Oh, my God. [gasps] I can't believe it. EVELYN: We have to read another one. MADELINE: No! One per day. That's the rule. [eerie music playing] [door clicks] Hey. Wake up. Get downstairs. What? MADELINE: This is my husband, Parker. - Have you seen Dawn? - Excuse me? I'm sorry to bother you, sir. Do you know Dawn Spooner? I didn't know her last name, but yeah, we know her. COP: How well do you know her? Not very well. We just moved in, so barely. Why... what's this about? Dawn's missing! - Who are you? - I'm Kristoff. I'm Dawn's boyfriend. I just got back from tour and the place is a fucking pigsty. All right. All right. Take it easy. We're asking the neighbors if they've seen her. Um, yeah. I mean, we usually see her walking around, walking her dog. COP: Did you see her this morning - or yesterday? - I'm telling you, man. She's been gone for days. The place is covered - in dog shit. - Sir, do you mind if I do my job? When did you see her last? Two, three days. - I don't know. - You see? That was days. He just said days. Did you notice anything out of the ordinary? - Like what? - Was she acting strange? Maybe she got into a car? I mean, she's just strange in general but no, nothing like that. - Maybe she left town. - KRISTOFF: No. No. She wouldn't leave without the mutt. She left her cell phone and ID behind, that's why we think she might still be in the area. Well, have you tried these? Because they're all over the place. Though... those just point at our property though. All right. Can you think of anything else? Even the smallest thing might help. Okay. There is something. Um... someone broke into our house - yesterday. - What? They didn't... they didn't really break in. - The doors were wide open. - Were you robbed? No. They just vandalized - a few things. - You were vandalized? - You left the doors open? - MADELINE: Mom? - Did you report it? - Yes. Yeah. I called. Did you check the footage? I mean, we could but they've been down for a while now. I need a new wire. I have a guy coming out to fix that. COP: Okay. If you think of anything else, you give us a call, okay? - Okay. - I'm sure she'll show up. Come on. EVELYN: You we're vandalized? - Mom. - You left your doors open? - Mom. - EVELYN: This is Los Angeles. This isn't Iowa. [dark music playing] - PARKER: It wasn't her? - MADELINE: Who was it? - PARKER: She didn't do this. - MADELINE: Then who was it? PARKER: Honey, you just have to trust me, it wasn't her. MADELINE: What is going on, Parker? - PARKER: It wasn't her. - MADELINE: What is happening in this house? There's a law. If a seller doesn't disclose - that a house is haunted... - Maddy. They have to give you your money back. - Don't be ridiculous. - It's true. Look it up. Even if a house has a reputation of being haunted, - they have to tell you. - Houses are not haunted. Okay? [eerie music playing] [child giggling] GIRL: She wants you. [child giggling] GIRL: ♪ She's gonna get you ♪ [child giggling] GIRL: He's gonna get you too. GIRL: She's gonna get you, Parker. [door creaks open] [sinister music playing] [child giggling and screams] No! [gasping] [dog barking] [phone ringing] - Hello? - ROB: Out of the park. - I fucking love it. - What? ROB: The pages, you weren't wrong. The best thing that you have ever written. I'm totally blown away. This guy is amazing. Who the hell is he? [suspenseful music playing] [birds chirping] [knocks on door] PARKER: Not now! I'm working! Hey. Don't yell at me! - I need to work! - I don't care. Don't ever yell at me. Sorry. Parker, what's wrong with you? You can't hide it anymore. It's like I'm breathing in your stress. I can smell it on your breath. It is heavy and it's scary, and you're not talking to me. I can't. We're supposed to be a team. You're right. It is this house. What? PARKER: I tried to keep it from you, but I can't anymore. Terrible things happened here. Why would you say that? Maddy, I just wanted to protect you. What the fuck are you talking about, Parker? He moved the house. He moved this house. - William. He moved this whole... - What? Who moved this house? Goddamn house to get away... - Parker? From her. - Okay. - But she found them, okay? - I don't know what you're... Shh. Shh. She found them. She found them and she killed them. - Parker? - She killed him. She killed her. She killed her little... Why are you saying these things? - She killed their daughter. - Now you're scaring me! - Maddy, Rebecca killed them! - Stop! EVELYN: Maddy! We've got a lot to do. Let's go! Tell me this didn't happen. EVELYN: Come on, honey. Let's... I'm coming! How do you know this? She told me. She doesn't want us to be together. Who? Parker, who? He couldn't get away from her and I don't think we can either. EVELYN: Grab my pocketbook. - I left it on the bed. - We're moving. We're leaving this fucking house. We are getting the hell - outta here. - She'll just find us. We're gonna get our money back and we are leaving this fucking house. Your money. [sighs] [dark sinister music playing] [metal soft clanging] [eerie music playing] [eerie music intensifies] PARKER: No. No. No. Stop. Please. Stop. You don't have to do this. You don't... shh. You can have me, okay? You can have me. [slow brooding music playing] I'll never leave you. Just don't hurt her. I never wanted to hurt anyone. I just want you. You have me. [foreboding music playing] [thuds] [crickets chirping] [Rebecca moaning] EVELYN: Parker? [sinister music playing] No! EVELYN: [on voicemail] Hi. Leave a message but not too long. Hi, Mom. I'm just checking in. Just give me a call whenever you get a chance, okay? MAN: Let's get the extras on the set. MAN: Extras, this way. Last looks! PARKER: [on voicemail] You reached Parker Brooks. - Please leave a message. - [phone beeps] [pensive music playing] [doorbell rings] DOROTHY: Yes? Hi. Are you Dorothy? Ah, the Woodruff's house has always been a favorite. True Queen Anne. They called it the house from Angels Flight. Why Angels Flight? Because that's where it was built, on the top of Angels Flight. And then they moved it. So they really moved the house? Uh-hmm. In 1901, they used draft horses. Back then, it was very common for people to move their homes. Do you know why they moved it? Uh-hmm. Oil. They found oil on the property. And suddenly, there were just huge oil derricks sprung up everywhere. Look. This is the last photo that was taken of the house before they moved. Old William just got fed up with the view. I think it was because of a woman named Rebecca. Do you know who she was? Oh, they wrote a lot of articles about her. She was an orphan. She was raised in the house next to you. She was half-Mexican or Native American. It's probably why she was abandoned in the first place. Poor thing. She was really a victim of her time. A young, unmarried woman in trouble, that's how they used to say it. - She was pregnant. - Uh-hmm. But she managed to hide it until she miscarried or, in all probability, she just aborted herself. They found the remains in the garbage incinerator. And then she committed suicide. You know, the newspapers always love a good scandal. There were rumors that William Woodruff was the father. And that she was the mistress. - But I just never believed it. - They lied to us. - I'm sorry? - They have to tell you bad things happen. Or else, I... Hmm. I never would have bought the house. Oh, this didn't happen at your house. No. I'm talking about the murders! - The murders? - Yes. His wife, his daughter. Oh, honey, nothing like that ever happened at your house. I mean, the Woodruffs lived to be quite old, and I actually saw the daughter. She came to visit me about 30 years ago. She was in her 80s. She was a very lovely woman. Are you all right? I'm... I'm sorry. I have to go. Oh, by the way. Did you frame it? The plate photo of Rebecca. It's quite fragile. If you frame it, it'll be safer. How did you know about the photo? Your husband showed it to me. Parker was here? Uh-huh. The writer? He came by after you moved here. Very nice man. You know, he was actually just as taken with Rebecca's story as you are. I have to go. [pensive music playing] Oh, my God. FRIDA: Hi. I'm looking for Parker Brooks. Does he live here? Why? I'm Frida Richmond. - Is he home? - What's this about? Well, it's a personal matter. I'm his wife. Oh. Well, may I see him? When did you and Parker marry? Um, September. Oh, he didn't even tell me he was engaged. I'm sorry. Who are you? I'm his counselor. Um... His appointed therapist? Parker doesn't have a therapist. I think I should speak to him. I'm sorry. Will you just... will you please just tell me what's going on? He's missed several months of appointments. And that's a violation of his court order. You mean regarding his stalker? Parker told you he had a stalker? [suspenseful music playing] [paper rustling] [suspenseful music continues] [breathes shakily] [beeping] [music intensifies] [muffled scream] [breathes shakily] [clattering] [screams] Oh, my... PARKER: Madeline. - I did not do this. - Parker. - What have you done? - Listen to me. - No. - Wait. No! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Listen to me! Listen to me! - Please let me go! - Maddy, you have to believe me. - No. - It wasn't me. - No! - Will you stop? - [Madeline screams] - What are you doing? - Somebody please help me! - I told you. Terrible things happened in this house. And they're still happening. - [Madeline cries] - Why are you doing this? Get away. What are you doing? - I'm not gonna hurt you. - No! I'm not gonna hurt you. - I could never hurt you. Never. - Please. Please stop, Parker! Would you just listen to me? Would you just listen? Listen. Shh, shh, shh, shh. You have to listen to me, Maddy. It was her. Rebecca did this. She did all of this. - MADELINE: No. - Okay? No! No! Why are you running! Would you just stop it! - Goddammit! - Get away from me! I told you! Rebecca did this! She did all this! I tried to stop her! [Madeline breathes heavily] Oh, my God. [dark music playing] People don't have to exist to be real. Pain is real. [fire crackles] Secrets are real. [Rebecca screams] I kept mine buried for too long. And they festered. And they grew inside of me. No. [cries] And they come out. [suspenseful music playing] [Madeline sobbing] And they eat you alive. Who are you? The only way I can save you is to be with her. You're crazy! [dark sinister music playing] Oh, no. Help! Please! Somebody help us! [cries] Please help me! Please help! Help! [cries] Please! Please! Please! Please! [suspenseful music playing] - [thuds] - [woman groans] [suspenseful music continues] [cocks gun] I am not crazy. - [gunshot] - [grunts] [Madeline screams] Please. Please. He belongs with me. [gunshot] [grunts] [yells] [gunshot] [sobbing] - [foreboding music playing] - [cries] [indistinct radio chatter] [police siren wailing] [sirens wailing in distance] REBECCA: To My One True Love. We all have secrets we lock in the dark. But when our secrets become so vast, so boundless, they escape. And send our very souls into darkness. Then secrets become our only truth. REBECCA AND PARKER: But alas, my love, there are no secrets anymore. REBECCA AND PARKER: And we are together as one. And in this house, we shall dwell. Forever. Hey, babe. Look at this. What? Get outta here. - Yeah. It was in the attic. - That's amazing. It's beautiful. [car horn honks] - Movers are here. - Yeah. Hey. What? We did it. New chapter. Welcome home. [both chuckles] [sighs] I wonder who she was. Oh, can you put that on the kitchen, please? Thanks guys. [dark foreboding music playing]
