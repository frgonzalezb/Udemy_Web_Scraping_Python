The roughest, toughest, rooting-est, shooting-est claim jumper... that ever jumped a claim. And I'm a-taking over your claim. Now get a-going before I puncture your hide. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHING] Ha, ha! He jumped around like a toady frog. Hmm. Pickings is mighty slim around here. Hardly no reward for a day's work. Here, Pierre, weigh this up. Yes, sir. And keep your thumb off of them scales, or I'll blow it off. She's pretty small. Ten dollars. Ten dollars? Why, it's getting so a man can't earn a dishonest living no more. BUGS: There's gold in them there hills. Well, back with another one, eh? Eh, uh, how about a couple of carrots for this rock, Pierre? PIERRE: Of course. Keep the change, doc. [SPEAKING GIBBERISH] Oh, sure, he does that all the time. They say when he is near gold, a funny feeling comes over him. He does? Hmm. Well, I got a funny feeling coming over me. [BUGS SCATTING] [SINGING] All I can see are rainbows in the sky [SCATTING] Huh. A collar button. I wish people would stop losing them things. Well, if it ain't my old friend, the rabbit. Say, I like you. You're a good Joe. I like you so much, I'm a-gonna make you my partner. All you has to do is find the gold, and I'll share it with you. Fifty-fifty. Honest and for true? Sure. Square-deal Sam, they call me. Well, what are we waiting for, partner? There's gold in them there hills. We ought to be getting near gold territory now. I'm beginning to get that peculiar feeling. -That's the spot. -Gold! Ha, I'm rich, I'm rich! Eureka! Gold! Maybe I should help. After all, we are partners. Partners? Our partnership is dissolved. This is all mine. Now beat it. Well, of all the double-crossing.... Gee, I couldn't do that to the little guy. Hey, Sam. SAM: Shut up! He should be along any minute now. SAM: I'll tear him from limb to limb. Aha! Caught you! Trying to get the gold for yourself, eh? Give me them tools. Now, scram, you dirty thief. That's what I get for trusting a rabbit. Great horny toadies, I must have dug clean through to Chinee. [CRASHING] SAM: Ooh! Ooh, I'll get that fur-bearing critter, even if I has to chase him... through every state in the Union. You'd better hurry, Sam, if you wanna catch me. I got my running pants on. On your mark, get set.... Go! Oh, no, you don't. You don't get me to go for that trick again. But I can't take any chances. Gold! I struck it rich! I'm a billionaire. I'm a trillionaire. I'm a zillionaire. I'm rich! I'm rich! I'm-- I'm-- [GROANS] Put me down! Now, it's my gold! I worked hard for it! Let me go, now! I'll call the cops! Put me down! It's my gold! I found it! Let me go! So long, Sam. See you in 20 years. And what are you doing here? Oh, uh, me? Well, I, uh-- Heh. I'm waiting for a streetcar. Oh, yeah? [HORN BLOWING] But in a spot like this, a boat will do. [HORN BLOWING]
