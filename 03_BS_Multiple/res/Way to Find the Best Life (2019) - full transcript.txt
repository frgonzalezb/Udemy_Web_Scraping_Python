The weather is clear at the launch pad. It's almost time. Folks from the press, please follow me. This way. 85, 84, 83, 82, 81... Nice to see you again, Mr. Aso. - Hello. - It's finally happening. Yes. It took so long. Less than 3 minutes. Excellent weather for the lift-off. I'm nervous. 33, 32, 31, 30... 29, 28, 27... 26, 25, 24... 23, 22, 21... Go. Go. Go. Go! The H2A rocket carrying Mars probe MAKO & SACHI was launched at 2:30:22 PM on January 17... Ms. Mako! Ms. Sachie! "The Bucket List" Hello there. Where's the yogurt? Don't run. Welcome, customers. Our special offers of the day are... We're starting the daily discounts now! Check them out. 20% discount on deli products. "Featured on TV" "Anti-cancer salad" Excuse me. May I take it? Excuse me. Can I get that half-priced salad? Is she okay? Hello. Takayasu is up. He's ranked "ozeki." He better win. Yes! Will you warm this up yourself? The judges are disagreeing? Warm this up yourself. Huh? Fine. They were just featuring dumplings on TV. I can't make dumplings tonight. No ingredients. Ikkei. I'll leave your dinner here. Ikkei? Sorry... It's just a bento from the supermarket. Hello? It's me. What's up? Do you have a minute? Hold on. Change this to "show off." Make it quick, Mom. The proofs are due tomorrow. Sorry. There's something you should know. I'm going to be hospitalized next week. Hospitalized? You? It's nothing serious. I need to get some tests for my stomach. Just tests? Yeah. I was hoping you'd come check up on your dad and Ikkei. Check up on them? Not every day but will you come cook and clean for them? I can't. Impossible. They can manage, can't they? Make them manage. You're right. Sorry I called when you're so busy. What happened? It's malignant. This gray area is where it has spread. "Sachie Kitahara, age 70" Stage 4. It's quite advanced. The temperature is dropping. Please beware of the cold weather. A luxury resort only 30 minutes from Tokyo. The Goda Hotel Urayasu Bay. Opening today. Ready? May we continue? With the opening of this hotel in Urayasu Bay the Goda chain now has over 50,000 guest rooms. Thank you. Thank you. We owe our success to the growing number of foreign visitors and the recovery of the domestic demand. But above all, thanks to everybody here today... Each and every one of you... I thank you for your greed that I personally had to indulge. "Tokyo Metropolitan Shiba Medical Center" It's true. Are you serious? Dr. Yamano has 3 kids at her age. Unbelievable. Why are you blushing? What do you think? Adorable. Who did she take after? She totally looks like you. That would upset her. Would it really? You're awful. Turn it off. Yes? This is Horii from Takara Investments. Hello, Mr. Horii. Thank you for the wonderful meal. You're welcome. So today... I'm going to my house in Milan. To get a little rest. Please think about our proposal. Yes, of course. I'll get back to you. I'll call you again. Sure. Until then. That Horii won't leave me alone. He's dying to buy us out. I'll never sell. I built this business like I was raising my own child. Ms. Mako... The fire alarm reacts to smoke. Go buy some plastic wrap to cover it up. Don't smoke until then. I won't. - Put that out. - Okay, okay. - Put it out. - I did. There's a fire... Why? There must be plenty of rooms. But they need time to... I told you I refuse to stay in a two-bedded room. What am I? Poor? There's a dying elderly patient... If I have to wait long, I'll probably die first. Hello. I'm the other occupant. My name is Kitahara. You... You don't know who I am? Pardon? So you don't know me. That's alright. I'm Mako Goda. Mako Goda. - She's... - Forget it, Takada. Go to that private room and pull a tube out of the patient. I'll go check it out. Did you hear? The fire alarm went off by mistake. The 9th floor is soaked. I wonder how it happened. Mako, my darling! I was so worried. This is a room for the poor. It's just temporary. This isn't our home. No smooching. Not here. I bought you yellow roses, your favorite. But I had to leave them at the door. Something about infections. So I bought you this at the store downstairs. She loves pudding. One for you. I'm Teruo. My husband. Mako, my love... I'm so lonely without you. You're fine. - Kiss me. - Not now. - We're not alone. - Okay. Don't tell anyone I'm here. It'll affect our stock prices. - Stop it. - Come on. - Nice, huh? - You look gorgeous. I need towels. "Towel: 500 yen" Pricey... Too bad I forgot to bring them. Miss... What? I want ice cream. Marie. No junk food. Let's go. Hurry up. The doctor's waiting. Mom. Miharu. I got you steamed cake. Thanks. You left your towels by the door. You're so thoughtful. Where do they go? In the drawer. The house was a mess. I did the dishes. I thought so. Get well soon. At this rate, they'll drown themselves in all that mess. What's wrong? You should know something. You see... I have... cancer. My treatment may take a while. So I want you to take care of your dad and Ikkei. The bank book and the insurance certificate are here. Just in case... For the funeral and other arrangements. Don't tell them about my condition. You're the only one I can count on. I can't. I can't promise you! I can't take care of Dad and Ikkei. Miharu... Because I'm the big sister? Because I'm a woman? Don't tell them you have cancer? Talking about dying already... Don't push everything on me! Sorry. I should go. Leaving so soon? Terminal? Yes. Me too. Ovarian cancer 5 years ago. It spread to my liver. My husband doesn't know. Lucky, aren't I? He's so sweet. Sure. Even though he brings his girlfriend with him. He doesn't think I know. So you do know. Did you see her? I bet she was young and ditzy. Yes, very much so. Do cigarettes taste good? May I try one? Please? Look. Stop it. Cigarettes aren't for children. She's smoking too. This is not for kids. You'll get cancer like me. But I suppose even non-smokers can get cancer too. See? It doesn't matter. No. Leave me alone. You dying old hag. Hag? Being sick doesn't give you the right to be selfish. I'm not being selfish. I put up with a lot. I have to get shots every day. My friends won't play with me because I might collapse. It's no use being alive. I'd rather die. Don't talk like that. Dying is not a joke. Kids... could also die. - Oh no! - I'll get someone. Are you okay? Hang in there. I'll get a doctor. Hang in there. Come on. Stay with me! "Marie" "Marie Kanzaki" Excuse me. Shota, thanks for waiting. Here you go. Bye. Hey, are you Marie's brother? This is your sister's. I don't want it. How is she doing? She died. It's not fair. My mom only pays attention to my sister. She was 12 years old. She had a severe case of type 1 diabetes. She needed to get shots every day. But she rebelled and refused to get them. That's all I found out. "Medication book" "Things I want to do before I die"... What's that? The important page is missing. "Things I want to do before I die" Is it her bucket list? I was going to wash them later. Sure you were. "Things I want to do before I die" You're good. Isn't it? It's time, Vice President. We'd like to take a vote now. Those of you in favor of my becoming the next president raise your hands. We have the majority so... Ms. Mako! Hold it. Ms. Mako! Mako. You were discharged already? What's going on here? During the short time I was gone were you trying to take over my company? There are rumors that you're sick and our stock is going down. We thought it wise to choose your successor. Ms. Mako... Hey. Do you think I'm going to die? It's nothing serious. I'll be cured before you know it. Are you sure? I talked to your doctor at the hospital. And I've already informed the board. I'll do my very best so think about it carefully. Think about what's best for the future of this company. This is Kitahara. What a surprise. What's up? I was trying to come up with my own bucket list. Oh. But I couldn't think of anything. I have no idea what I can do for fun. I have no dreams. But... that girl had many. She wanted to live. Live her life to the fullest. Enjoy life and have fun. She was full of hope. So I'm going to do it. Her bucket list. To honor her death or something? No. For myself. Wow. I didn't think you were so crazy. I don't want to just sit around and wait to die. Well then... Wait. Count me in. I have to do something. Can I change my mind? Do I really have to? Oh please... This was your idea. To check off the things on her list. Skydiving is one of them. There's no turning back now. But... I don't know... You started this. Now do it. Don't be a wimp, Takada. Hurry up. On the TV shows, the staff goes first to make sure it's safe for the celebrity. Go, Takada! It looks fine. Let's go. Okay. No! No! No! This is great! Wonderful! Mako! Mako! Mako! Open your eyes. Come on. I'm... a bird! I'm sorry! Sorry! Amazing! "Going on a trip. - Sachie" Mr. Takada. Are you okay? Yes. - Thank you. - Have some water. This is touching. Yes. You're like an old man. Get a hold of yourself. Sit up. Go back to Japan and get ready for the next one. Are you really okay? He's fine. Takada, stop stooping. Stand straight. Let's go. "Go skydiving" Buying the lottery is no way to get rich. The last one. Getting rich isn't that easy, is it? The lottery is for fools. "Get rich" Don't worry about it. I'm filthy rich. Don't you feel like a millionaire on my private jet? Well, yes but... I envy the poor. You think money will bring you happiness. I have money but it doesn't cure my cancer. My husband cheats on me. I might lose my company. Money doesn't solve everything. I know but... Oh? Do you also want to be rich? I want to leave some money for my children. You're a bad parent. Don't take away the joy of working from your kids. But then again, there are worse parents... Where? - Go left. - Left? You went too far. Go right. Yes. Good. Now up. There we go. Ready? Did you get it? Why the Sphinx? It's not on her list. I wanted to travel as a tourist. Not on business. Look. Nice. You really don't have anything you want to do? As a housewife, I never did anything for myself. The pyramids... I'm absolutely awestruck. Amazing, isn't it? It was built 5,000 years ago. What is it for? They used to think that pyramids were graves. But there were other graves. It probably meant nothing. Just like us. The pharaoh wanted to do something meaningless before he died. Something for himself instead of his people. Cheers, pharaoh. Humans never change. Ow! Ow! Mako! What are you doing?! Wear this. Thank you. Thank you. We're in luck. Their last concert of the year... What? You think we'll be dead next year? No... It's okay. Thanks for the tickets. No, it's not that... We're going to change. Turn around. You wanna watch? No... - You do? - No. - Can you see? - Not a thing. This way. It already started. Here's our door. What's so great about Momoclo? Huh? What? Only a kid would want to go to a Momoclo concert. She was a kid. Okay, everyone! Let's chat a little bit. Let us hear your voices. All of you... Teenagers! In your 20s! A lot. In your 30s! Then... Not 40s or 50s but 60s! You skipped too much. - Did I? - Definitely. People in their 60s. - Yeah. - That's so nice. We have a big fan base. Should I take it a step further? - In your 70s! - Anyone? Maybe not. Let me hear you. No way. Anyone? No? Here! We have one! - There! - Where? - There. - Wow! Really? Give her a microphone. Let's hear from her. Not me. I'm not in my 70s. I'm a friend. The 70-something is... Come on. They're waiting. Just say something. You two came together? No... It's us here and... one more. A 12-year-old girl... brought us here. 12? Your grandchild? No. A friend. Um... She also... really wanted to be here. Where is she? She couldn't make it today. So... I'm here in her place today to dance and sing with you... and have fun! Awesome! They should come onstage. Yes! Let's dance together! You can't be serious. No... Please come up onstage. No. You have to. How can you refuse? Thank you. It was fun! Let's get a big round of applause! "Go to a Momoclo concert" Alright. Next. "Back hip circle." I could never do it. Really? But you can practice. No way. Impossible. I have an athletic build but looks can be deceiving. I'm no good at sports. You do it. Then next. "Eat the biggest parfait in Japan." I can't do the rest. "Confess my love." "Wear a wedding dress." Did you wear one? I wanted to but my mother-in-law told me to wear a kimono. Where did you meet your husband? At a summer festival in my hometown. The strings of my sandal broke. My husband was visiting from Tokyo. He let me wear his sandals. Are you serious? It sounds like a TV drama. We got married right after college. I didn't want my parents to worry about me. Say thanks to Mom and Dad. I can't do this either. I've lost both my parents. Me too. Both of them? My mom died when I was small. My dad disappeared... leaving a debt when I was in 4th grade. He was a terrible father. My name... It's not really Mako. My real name is Kumako. "Kuma" as in "bear." It's a nice name. I was teased all the time. It sucked. I hated my parents for it. "Kyoto" - Wow. - It's huge. Gigantic. Who ordered the jumbo parfait? Here. Here you go. Wow. Be careful. This is unreal. Enjoy yourselves, ladies. I don't think we can finish this. I agree. Girls, would you like to help us eat this? Really? Of course. Right? Sure... Why not? - Thank you. - Thank you. Yum! This is great. I'm gonna get fat. It's too late. You guys, come and eat with us. Please help yourselves. Oh dear... Wow. Eat as much as you want. One more, please. No. Make it two. Yes, ma'am. - I'm so full. - Are you okay? I'm getting heartburn. Eating sweets. Hanging out with friends. She dreamed of doing the ordinary things in life. But the biggest parfait in Japan. Why in Kyoto? Isn't there a bigger one in Tokyo? Ah geez... Look. Beautiful. Um... There's a place I'd like to visit. This place... "Nursing home for the elderly" Did Takada tell you? I refuse to see him. Takada should know that. I'm Kitahara, the one who called. Hello. Tokuji, your daughter is here to see you. Mako, wait! Don't run away! Mako! Don't patronize me. You don't know anything. Do you know what it's like to hide from debt collectors? To have nothing to eat? My hatred for him has kept me going all these years. He may have forgotten but I remember everything! You're the one who's running away. You haven't told your husband about your disease. What's the use of being a family if you can't open up to each other? You're the coward! Hey, Kuma! Kuma! Kuma! Kuma the bear! "Kumako Goda" Bear! You stink. Smelly. We wanna go home. Hurry up! Do it! You're wasting our time. Bear! Klutz. Shut up! Shut up! Damn you! Good job! Back hip circle! Good girl. Good for you. Good... Good... Very good. You recognize me? Good girl. You... Good girl. You're a good girl. Daddy... Good girl. I feel great this morning. Excuse me. We'll take your luggage to the lobby. Thank you. Take that one. You can check this off. "Do something that makes someone happy." I'm... glad that I saw him. I'm happy for you too. You earned your way into Heaven. Heaven? A great accomplishment. For a simple housewife like you. Simple? How have you earned your way into Heaven? Me? Many things. I've gone to places and met people and seen views that an average person can't. I've also worked hard and paid a lot of taxes. I have my ticket to Heaven. My life hasn't been boring like yours has been. Don't insult me. Don't belittle my life. Why are you so worked up? I'm sorry if I offended you. A housewife isn't as carefree as you think. I've had to tolerate a lot. I've wanted to run away. I've had to give up on many things. I... I don't have... any great accomplishments. But... every day I've done my best. My very best... My family... Are you okay? Hey! Somebody! Ma'am. Your IV drip. The last one today. I'll be back later. Why didn't you tell me about your disease? Something so important. You shouldn't have been traveling. I wanted to go on an adventure. When your mother was still alive I tried to please her. Then Ikkei started to shut himself in his room. Since then... I've never gone out. When I learned of my disease... I didn't want to die being holed up in the house. Is it that bad? Being home with me? It was fine when Miharu and Ikkei were small. I was happy... watching them grow. But now... Will you... let me... continue my journey? "Nagasaki" "The Tagawa family grave" "Say thanks to Mom and Dad" This place is beautiful. I'm glad I came. I haven't been here in 20 years. Having cancer has its advantages. We won't have to worry about old age. Is that all? Are you serious? Say you're glad you met someone famous like me. I'm happy now, thanks to you. What's wrong? I was just thinking if this was the end... Against my family's wishes I'm traveling around doing what I want. Maybe I'm scared for the journey to end. Let me see that. There's a few left. We'll have to give up on this last one but... "Space travel" Children of today don't have to. But this. You can still do it. "Wear a wedding dress" Beautiful. I'm jealous that you look so great. I feel awkward. Don't be silly. You have to. It's on her list. Let's go take photos. Everybody, laugh. Louder, please. Good. Don't just curl your lips. Let your eyes sparkle. Now applaud and smile. Yes. There she is. Go to your places. Stand straight. Here we go. I hired extras to make it more realistic. Miharu! The husband isn't an extra. Go. Sachie, marry me. Excuse me? Even in our next lives will you marry me? Right... You can't answer, can you? I... I've been a bad husband. I made you take care of my mother. I didn't help you raise the kids. I thought it was okay. You never complained. So I took advantage of it. I neglected your feelings. All in all... I've been an unreliable husband. I'm sorry. But starting today, I'll do my best to make you happy. Don't go anywhere and stay by my side. But if you still want to travel, I'll go with you. I want you by my side. No... I want to be by your side. Alright. So yes? My journey is over. Thanks. Won't you please trust this miracle and our fate? No matter what happens I'll never let you go Embrace this burning heart of mine The tenderness of that day all around us Mako. This is for you. We're checking out. I don't want extra stuff. Don't be so mean. You're amazing. Why? For 50 years, you stood by a lousy husband and got him to say those things to you. Maybe I shouldn't give up yet. Don't set off the fire alarm again. You knew? Everybody did. A crazy millionaire smoked and flooded the 9th floor. Seriously? "Notification of divorce" What's this? I've been good to you and the company. It was my mistake to make you vice president. What about the company? I sold it to Takara Investments. It'll keep the Goda Hotel name and some of our executives. You're a liar but I was fine with it. Yet... some lies are unforgivable. What lies? You invested company funds without board approval. We lost over 3 billion yen. So you knew. I did. But I wasn't strong enough to confront you. I never knew you loved me that much. Surprised? I'm firing you and pressing criminal charges against you. Now get out. The year is almost over. Ameyoko in Ueno, Tokyo, is teeming with shoppers. That's not how you... Mom, no. Sit down. He has to learn to do things by himself. Try it. Good. Phew. You try it too. Here. Good! It's just like Mom's. What's the matter? Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Are you...? Miharu... Don't tell Dad. Does the father know? No. He's my subordinate. I don't think he wants to marry me. But you want the baby. Then you have to tell him. Some things have to be put into words. Don't give up so easily. I think I should have asked more of your dad. I should have been more assertive and told him how I felt. I regret it. Come. Come with me. Open the door! Just open the door! Ikkei, listen to me. Miharu is pregnant. Mom, no! It's pointless. In the near future I'll be gone. So... you... You have to help her. Your sister... and the baby... Love them. Help them. Be there for them. Please. That's all I ask. Promise me. Good. Thank you. I have something else to say. I... I... I love you. I love you, Miharu. And... I love you. I mean it. Yeah, we know. "Confess my love" I chose the photograph. Please read this. About the succession of assets. It's her will certified by the family court. And... This. A check. She wants you to use the money however you see fit. "20 billion yen" I have no idea how all this money should be spent. I'm practically a complete stranger. No... Absolutely not. I have a letter from her. Please read it and decide. "Dear Sachie." "They say you can make all the money in the world" "but you can't take it with you when you die." "It's true." "But I have a legacy, a child called my company." "That's enough." Mr. Takada... They're her words that I wrote down on paper. In the end... she couldn't even hold a pen. Shall I continue? Dear Sachie. They say you can make all the money in the world but you can't take it with you when you die. It's true. But I have a legacy, a child called my company. That's enough. And what makes me happier than anything is that I met you while I was still alive. I won't admit this to anyone but you. I never had confidence in myself. Just being alive wasn't enough for me. I had to prove my worth by being rich and successful. So I always wanted more. But I was wrong. Don't insult me. Loving and appreciating the life you lead each and every day... You made me realize the preciousness of it all. Enjoying food and laughing together. Letting ourselves go to sing and dance. Sincerely wishing for someone else's happiness. I acted tough but... in truth I was afraid. So afraid of death that I wanted to scream. But... after I met you, there was no time to be scared. We were too busy arguing and laughing. I'm glad I was alive. I'm glad I met you. Thank you, Sachie. It's not in the letter but she said to me afterwards. "Takada, don't worry." "One day, you'll meet a friend like her." "Things I want to do before I die" Wait for me, Mako. It won't be long. "Space travel" How cute. "350 yen" Buy it. It's cute. You... You're cheap. Don't look at me like I'm a ghost. I'm so happy to see you again. I saw you two on YouTube at the Momoclo concert. Totally awesome. I loved it. You look well. I'm glad. They put me in intensive care that day. I'm now getting my shots every day. I go to school too. I'm sorry I lied to you. Don't worry about it. What? Nothing, right? Let's go. Hold on. This is yours. You had it? You can throw it away. I'm not going to die. Bye. - We're back. - What did you get? It's a secret. "Three years later" Separate. We did it! Good job! Today at 2:30 PM, Mars probe Mako & Sachi... Look. Grandma's rocket. ...was successfully launched. Japan's first Mars probe was named after Kumako Goda and Sachie Kitahara who passed away 3 years ago and made a significant contribution to this huge step in the research of the solar system. Go! Fly! Go! Go! Fly! Go! Ms. Mako! Ms. Sachie! Fight! Mako & Sachi! Fly! Keep going!
