I'll tell you what, I'll take you too. You sugar plum. One-two! One-two! One-two! One-two! One-two! One-two! Come on. Hey there. Let's hear you count now. One-two! One-two! Wow-two! One-two! One-two! One-two...! One-two! One-two! One-two! Old-man! Ah. So you want to become my student. I don't take on many students. Eh... Just those I think have promise. Mm-hmm. You think you have what it takes now, do you? Well, I'm not sure what it takes. But I can watch TV if I have to. Eh? Oh-ho hohoho. So we have ourselves our wise-guy huh? - Woo hoo hoohoohoo. - Stop that! Hey, I don't have to accept you as a student you know. Huh? You hear me? What's that? Huh? I wish chewing too loud to hear him. What? I can barely see him. How can you hear him? I don't know, I just can. Huh? Ahhhhhh. - Huh? - Huh? Yaaaaaa! Eh... nice to meet you. Goku, can you give him a hand? I slipped. Might you be the great Master Roshi? That would be me alright. I'm very honored to make your acquaintance. My name is Krillin and I was hoping that you would accept me as one of your students. Well, you young punks are all alike. No gifts. You just come to eat me out of house and home. Well, I can't afford 2 of ya' so there. Humph. Of course, you're right, I'm sorry. Forgive my lack of manners sir. Allow me to humbly offer this to you as a gift. Now that's more like it. Yes yes yes and yes kaboom! That's what I call a pictorial. I'm glad that my gift pleases you. So, who are you anyway? Me, my name is Goku. Hmm... I guess your Master Roshi's only student. Well not yet, nope. Well I see. So you're a little nobody. Did you know that you're completely bald? Of course! All great martial artist shave their head! That so the enemy can't grab their hair you fool! Look! Master Roshi shaves his head! Actually it all fell out. Well Krillin, you won that last round but Goku, was here first. Tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna give you boys a test and whoever passes it will become my student ok? Oh no, I never went to school. Not that kind of test! This is a test of ability and strength and cunning. Humm? Hey I understand, we're gonna fight each other right? - Nope, wrong. - Huh? No, this is no ordinary test boys. If you two consent to take this test, it will take all your willpower and ability just to live to tell about it. Sounds pretty cool to me. I'm afraid this test will put you boys in grave danger. That's ok. Yeah, no fear here. Let's hope so. Now listen up. Ages ago when demons and monsters still roamed the earth. An evil count named Lucifer took a beautiful Princess hostage and locked her up in his castle. Legend has it that he put his sleeping spell on her. And that she still there to this day. She must be starving. No she's not starving you putz! She has a spell on her. Now look! Whoever rescues the Princess and brings her here gets to be my student. Finally after all of these years I figured out the legend of the sleeping Princess. I'm sure of it! At now... at last... She's mine. So do we get started right away? Mm-hmm. Well, that is... if both of you boys' consent. So, what do you say boys? - Yeah sure, I'm in. - I'm in too. Well good! So how are we going to find the castle? Are you going to give us a map or something Master Roshi? Nope, I'm going to point. There, there it is. - But, I can't see it. - Will you be quiet! If he says it's there, it's there. No wait, wait. Goku's right. There. I guess my staff needs a tune-up. Alright boys, just keep traveling straight in this direction and you'll eventually run right into the castle. How far do you think it is? Well uh, I'm not exactly sure. Um, what's that Princess's name? Wait! Er... Hachoo. Phew. Man. Alright Princess Hachoo I'm on my way. He's not the least bit worried. Hmm... Well, I guess it's time for the two of you to get going. - Right. - Right. - Yo nimbus! - Goku wait...! Huh? I'm afraid you can't take the nimbus. Nimbus huh... Sorry son, the flying nimbus would give you an unfair advantage. Boys, you're gonna have to use your own two feet. You got it? Right, I've got it. - Hey... - What's up? Let's put all of our differences aside. Win or lose we’re in this race together. May the best man win. Wow, you bet. Now! So long sucker! That wasn't very nice. Good luck boys. Ha ha-ha haa. Man, I'll never catch him. Huh? Ahhhh! - Hey! - Hmm? We're under attack! - Huh? - Right over there, look! Ohh! Ahhh~~~. Vaya con dios monkey boy. Hey! What?! Where?! - I'm over here. - Huh?! Bulma! Don't ever do that again! I could have had a heart attack! A little jumpy there aren't you Master Roshi? - Hey hey! - Yo. My goodness, the whole gang's here. To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit? Now Master Roshi, we don't need an excuse to visit an old friend, do we? Yeah well... Oh no, and while we're at it how bout a little hooter hugging old friend, eh? You pervert! We're just trying to find Goku. Oh, the kid? He's taking a little trip to the devil's hand. Oh wow, how come? Er, I think he ah... Wanted to do some hiking. No way. I bet you sent him to get something that you want. What! Nonsense! Not me! All that rubbish about a sleeping Princess is just an old myth. - Huh? - Oh... Er... gosh, I did say Princess, didn't I. Oh well, might as well shoot for the best. You sent him for a girl? Well, so what, it's probably just an old myth anyhow. Figures. Now don't be like that. Just... a little... farther. Come on. Hello. Whoa! Hey, we're almost there. There, look. Huh? I've never seen anything like it. Isn't it beautiful? Oh yeah. A beautiful place for a nightmare. You thinking what I'm thinking? I don't know. What are you thinking? Oh. It is the devil's hand. Nah, no way. Hey! Wait up. Waaow! Hey look, these rocks look a lot like teeth. Oh yeah? Golly, I hadn't noticed. Hey, what the heck is this place? It's gloom city out there. Only Goku would be dumb enough to walk up to a place like this. Oolong be quiet all you ever do is complain. Look, I got a bad feeling Bulma. It seems we have some visitors Igor. Send out the welcoming party. Yes boss. Perhaps will be serving refreshments at the ceremony after all. Your right, somethings wrong. But I can't put my finger on it. Huh? Ahhh! Bulma! - Oh no, we're all gonna die! - Ahhhh! - Oh mommy! - Ahhhh! Man, creepy. Huh? Hey Krillin, what's wrong. You not scared, are you? Who me? No way man. Don't be alarmed, he's quite harmless. Hey, where am I? And who are you? Forgive me please my name is count Lucifer. Here, have some. My gosh, I will thanks. It seems you have a run-in with castle security. Oh yeah, that's right. You attacked. I did not. Well maybe you didn't but your goon squad did. They tried to kill us. Nearly did. Don't be silly, they wouldn't. There just a little overprotective that's all. You be here in this comfortable room if we had wanted you dead? I guess not. Well, no, you're right. So, can I see my friends now? Why of course. Right. So, may I give you a hand? Oh yeah, gee thanks. I still feel a little woozy. It's the altitude. Your blood is a lot thinner up here. Huh? - Hmm... wow. - Hmm... Hey, is this place radical or what? Yeah, radically scary. Uh-oh, here they come. What do you mean I don't see anybody. Yep, looks like a whole army. What!? Ahh!~~~ Eeh! Earth to Goku, let's get out of here! Ahh!~~~ - Hey! - Huh? Thought you could outsmart us by playing dead like a putz. Let the Princess go! Leave now and you'll live. No, you don't scare me! I leave but not until you let the Princess go! She's not a person you dummy. What? Liar! Liar?! Yes sir. Huh? Oh no! Waaaah! Huh? Ow! Power pole extend! Oof! Take that! Krillin here I come! Ahhh! Ahhh! Aye yi, yi yi yi yi, yi yi yi. Yi yi yi! Eeeeyaaaa! Hum? Ah! Think it's time to make my move. Yes, Igor is responsible for the baroque decor of the castle. Well he certainly did a great job. It's super. My castle has been host too many magnificent guests. But I count you among the most beautiful. Oh my goodness count you're making me blush. That just means your blood is rushing to your head. That's so unromantic. Forgive Igor he considers himself to be a scientist. A blood expert you might say. Now, where here. Please come. It's very sweet but if looks could kill I'd be dead. Silence! Silence please, we have an honored guest today. Thank you. May I introduce to you the beautiful miss. Bulma! Goodness gracious, my first standing ovation. Whoa. Yes it's a real treat for the undeadly. How strange what are they all laughing about count? One can never be sure with this wild bunch. But I think they're laughing because they see that you don't quite get the - point of our little gathering. - Hmm? What point! That point?! That's right. A needle for you! We have a very special ceremony coming up and we were hoping to borrow some of your blood for a toast. Let the ceremony begin! Let me go! Help! Yamcha! Yaaaaa!~~~ huh? Did you guys hear that? It sounded like Bulma. Huh? Ahhh! Please let me go! Hey! Krillin! Whoa! Ahhh! Krillin! Yo! Nimbus! Ahhh!~~~ Whoa, thanks. No problem, here have a seat. Waaa!~~~ I forgot to tell you. You have to be pure of heart to ride on the flying nimbus. What's that supposed to mean? Here, just hold on. You save my life. That thing would be digesting me about now. Nah, it probably would've spit you back out. Yeah, I can't believe Roshi sent us here, can you? - Hmm? - Too dangerous. Hey look. Company. - Uh-huh. - Yikes! What are they! Looks like flying monsters with machine guns. Oh no. Woooow! Goku, behind! We better make this thing go faster or we're dead meat. Goku, he's gaining on us! Hurry! I never do this sort of thing at least... On the first date! Relax miss. Bulma this is to sterilize against infection. Oh, how considerate of you. Friends monsters and elating guest lend me your ears. Tonight we will share a toast together. Thanks to the beautiful miss. Bulma who is supplying the refreshments for this momentous occasion. Refreshments? Tonight the Princess will awaken! Oolong did you hear that? Don't talk! Let's get out of here! She's history. Igor, it's time. What! Oh oh oh oh! No! Oh! Bulma! What's going on?! Ahhh!~~~ ahhh!~~~ the Princess! Somebody help! Man! Goku, what are we going to do now? No look! Just think a rock like that's gotta be with millions. Get that girl! Monster mash graveyard smash. The sleeping Princess is mine now you putrid pale punks. Did you hear what she said Goku? Is that pretty rock called the Princess! Get that girl! Kill her! Not today fang face . She's getting away! Goku! Aw-man there goes our ticket out of here. Goku? Goku!! Goku!! Ahh!! Goku how could you!?! Bulma! It's me Yamcha. Hmm? Funny that names strange. Uh, I yes sir I'm uh o-one of the new r-recruits. Yeah, I can vouch for him. No one scarier than us. We're partners huh? Hey, Oolong! You lost your shape! You're not a monster anymore. Oop uh-oh. Auf wiedersehen. Take that you monster pigs! Ha! She's scarier than the monsters! Huh? Ahhhh!~~~ woo, how did I wind up here? Yay, I've got it! Great. Now to bring this back to Master Roshi and be his student. Not so fast. Krillin! Goku! Give me the sleeping Princess back or I'll rip his head off. Well?! Here take it. Wow Goku... All right, now put him down. A deal's a deal. Who's next? Goku... That's enough boys. Just give him one more good one for me. Yes. The moment has finally arrived my gruesome friends. Rejoice for the season of fear and chaos will soon be upon us. Soon the creatures of darkness will be the regents of the planet. There will be a picture of a monster on every cereal box. Let the Princess awaken! So that her brilliant light... May lead us into unending darkness. The Princess is awake! Silence, please. I'd like each of you to take the hand of the monster next to you and pause for a moment of silent reflection. Aw you think you're tough huh? Well I could take you out buddy boy, maybe, but he's got a pretty mean little bite. What? Huh? Hey, aren't you scared Puar? Yeah, but the moon sure is pretty. Where is the moon? Wow! That is pretty. Hey, what's up? Oolong, check Goku out. Oh no, not again. It's a full moon! Oh no! So even the great Goku get scared every now and then huh. Hey bud, I wouldn't laugh at him if I were you. Grrr! Ahhh! Here we go again into ape city. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Ahh! Ahhh! Oh, no! We've got MightyMike77070.. His tail is his weak point. We've got to do something. His tail is his weak point. In that case I guess we have to jump on and squeeze. Huh? Hey Puar! Turn into a giant pair of scissors! Right scissors! The devil's hand it's collapsing?! Don't worry master. It's only the pinky finger. You're right, there's no need to lose our cool. Exactly. The master plan is still in effect. What is the master plan? The plan master came up with. I understand the part about the ape. But what happened to my clothes? Huh? Whoa! Gosh, why did I lose my balance? Oh no! Not my tail! Not again! `` My gosh! No no no! - Wow poor kid. - Poor tail. My tail is gone! Oh, well. Brother. Hey guys, it's not over yet. Those creeps still have Bulma! Bulma? How many days? How many days Igor, have we been waiting on this very moment to arrive? What's going on? What are you going to do? Why won't you tell me what you're going to do? I can't stop you. Alright then. We're going to blow up the sun. What! You're going to blow up the sun? But that's crazy! We need the sun for us to survive! Maybe you need the sun to survive. But to us, it's just a nuisance. You see dear, we love darkness. Bulma! Over here! Visitors! Igor! Bulma! Goku! Thanks Krillin! Come on! Goku! That big machine! Don't let him fire it! It will destroy us! Ka... me... Ha... me... Ha! Let's get out of here! You're great kid. Thank you. Always remember I'm the one who discovered you. - Goku... - Huh? Hey, what's wrong? Well, we failed. No Princess. Yeah, but we did our best. Hey, you save the day but don't forget who supplied the pants. Kids, say cheese. Cheese! Whoo wee! You boys did it! - We did? - We did? Yes, you brought me the sleeping Princess. Me? But I'm not a Princess. Oh gosh, she's a humble gal, isn't she? But she's telling the truth, Master Roshi. Master, aren't you forgetting your code? Does this mean I pass the test and get to be your student? Does a dog bark! Heck yeah boy you're in. Wow, way to go Goku. Hey, I see you learn some manners. You're in too. Wow really?! Well you must be wide awake after all of that sleeping. Come on in I'll show you my pad. Goku we did it! We did it! Right yeah! We did it! - Where the best. - Eat lead baldy! Now dance!
