It's so troublesome<br>to pee in the jungle.<br><br>Gosh! Where can I find a big tree?<br>Forget it, I'll just do it here.<br><br>But I think<br>this tree used to be big.<br><br>Now it has shrunk.<br>Is it because of the cold?<br><br>But before peeing, which is<br>the front part of the tree?<br><br>It's not nice<br>to pee face to face, isn't it?<br><br>It's embarrassing.<br><br>But there's nothing?<br><br>Keep going.<br><br>I swear, what is it?<br>A ghost?

Mbah?<br><br>I am Mbah Kawi.<br><br>Your father<br>did come to this place.<br><br>He was very ambitious...<br><br>...to expand<br>his cigarette factory...<br><br>...but I could not help him.<br><br>Meaning,...<br><br>...my father didn't go ahead with<br>the black magic to get rich here?<br><br>Yes, because<br>your father wanted...<br><br>...it to be very<br>fast and guaranteed.<br><br>I will always<br>help people, anyone...<br><br>...who comes here to ask for<br>the black arts to get rich...<br><br>...in a subtle and humane way.<br><br>Without the use<br>of any sacrifice...<br><br>...even if it<br>is only as tiny...<br><br>...as an ant.<br><br>So, my father<br>did not make any deal...<br><br>...with you, Mbah Kawi.<br>-No.<br><br>That did not happen.<br><br>If it wasn't with you...<br><br>...then with whom, Mbah?<br>-It's possible that he looked...<br><br>...for another shaman<br>but still from around here...<br><br>...who used<br>several sacrifices...<br><br>...and all those spirits are...<br><br>...those who were<br>killed by your father...<br><br>...to be sacrificed<br>to the point...<br><br>...your father<br>became insane and...<br><br>...he often ""halunisasi"".<br><br>Hallucinated, Mbah.<br>-Yes, that. What was it?<br><br>Hallucinated.<br>-Hallucinated. That's correct.<br><br>By the way, Mbah.<br>But Mbah,...<br><br>...can you help my father?<br>-Yes, sure.<br><br>I will help your father<br>to the best of my ability.<br><br>Mbah, if I may know,...<br><br>...what is this?<br>-In that bottle,...<br><br>...contains<br>holy water full of spells...<br><br>...and later,<br>when you get home,...<br><br>...give this water<br>to your father to drink...<br><br>...and hang this little kris<br>on the wall.<br><br>Understand?<br>-Understand, Mbah.<br><br>Contact me<br>if something happens...<br><br>...that you<br>can't handle. Understand?<br><br>Understand, Mbah.<br>Mbah, thank you very much.<br><br>By the way, Mbah.<br>How much must I pay for all this?<br><br>Payment?<br>-Yes.<br><br>I help sincerely, young man.<br><br>So, there's no need to pay.<br>There's no need for such things.<br><br>But if you want to give<br>any amount, I will accept.<br><br>There is one thing<br>that's more important,...<br><br>...when you get home,...<br><br>...don't forget<br>to stomp your feet three times.<br><br>One, two, three,<br>four, five. Mbah, Mbah.<br><br>What?<br>-That's five, Mbah.<br><br>That's four.<br><br>Yes, I know.<br><br>What it means is<br>not more than three times.<br><br>Oh, no.<br>-Understand?<br><br>I got it.<br><br>Guys, hopefully with this,<br>my father's psyche will...<br><br>...be healthy again, right?<br>-Just be calm. Amen. Yes?<br><br>Amen.<br>-What's important now,...<br><br>...our long journey<br>will be smooth.<br><br>We'll be going back tomorrow,<br>now we'll just relax first.<br><br>What? We're going back tomorrow?<br>-Yes.<br><br>Not going back today?<br>-Enough of that.<br><br>So, what do we do now,<br>Jono? The rest of you?<br><br>Do we want to stay at<br>the hotel first or what?<br><br>What? What?<br>What do you mean?<br><br>You're really crazy.<br>Hey! Look at this!<br><br>Look at this!<br>I've brought this thing!<br><br>My hand has carried the weight<br>till my veins are popping.<br><br>You simply want to stay<br>at a hotel. Set up a tent!<br><br>All right then.<br>Set it up there. Over there.<br><br>Go set it up.<br>-Set it up now over there.<br><br>We want to camp, right?<br>-Yes.<br><br>Jono, you know how to do it,<br>that's why you're setting it up.<br><br>Just until the workshop coverage.<br>-Enough of that. Just do it.<br><br>'No entry'.<br><br>Hi.<br>-Hey, Sweetheart.<br><br>It's cold.<br>-I just want to ask.<br><br>Where's Jono?<br>What's taking so long?<br><br>Yes, that's right.

You get some rest,<br>all right? Go to sleep, all right?<br><br>Yes.<br>-So you'll wake up fresh, okay?<br><br>Till we meet again<br>tomorrow, all right?<br><br>Till tomorrow, all right?<br>-Bye.<br><br>Bye. Sweetheart, get some rest.<br>-Yes.<br><br>Where is Jono?<br><br>Jono?<br><br>Jono?<br>-Jono?<br><br>Dika.<br>-Yes?<br><br>It's true, right?<br>Jono is missing.<br><br>Oh, gosh!<br>What are we going to do?<br><br>That's not possible, Adit.<br>Hasn't he lived here a long time?<br><br>Obviously<br>he's quite experienced.<br><br>What's that, Dika?<br>-I don't know.<br><br>I think there's<br>someone there. Jono?<br><br>What? I'm not sure.<br>-Yes, enough of that.<br><br>Come on, let's go.<br>-Yes, yes. Let's just go.<br><br>A rubber ball?<br><br>Jono! Jono!<br>-What's wrong with you?<br><br>You just barged into me!<br>-Jono, Jono, help me.<br><br>Jono,.....<br>-What is it?<br><br>In the tent just now, Jono.<br>A ball came, I gave it back.<br><br>It came back even bigger,<br>I gave it back again. Then,...<br><br>...it came again, I gave it back<br>again, it became a head, Jono!<br><br>Head of the family?<br>-No! That's my father!<br><br>A real head, Jono!<br>-Perhaps you saw wrong.<br><br>All the stump heads<br>are in the tent.<br><br>It's true, Jono.<br>It was so creepy, Jono.<br><br>Try look again.<br>-Jono, help me.<br><br>I'm constantly helping you.<br>Enough of that, see for yourself.<br><br>Check again?<br>-Yes, go there and check.<br><br>How can a guy be scared?<br><br>Jono, it's no longer there.<br><br>Your head is missing too!<br><br>That is Vieuw's voice.<br><br>Perhaps it's because I miss him.<br>Till tomorrow morning, all right?<br><br>I'm sure there are<br>a lot of ghosts here, Dika.<br><br>Not possible. Isn't.....<br><br>Vieuw! Vieuw!<br>-Hey, Vieuw! What is it?<br><br>Put your tongue<br>in first before you talk.<br><br>Stump head ghost.<br><br>It was so creepy, you know?<br>-What?<br><br>What is it?<br>-I was in the tent,...<br><br>...I thought it was Jono,<br>right? When I looked,...<br><br>...it was the stump of a head!<br>-You're lying, aren't you?<br><br>You want to scare<br>the both of us?<br><br>What's the matter<br>with you? Are you ill?<br><br>Why do you keep doing this?<br>Is your neck in pain?<br><br>Your face is ugly,<br>don't make it worse.<br><br>Vieuw? Vieuw?<br>-Vieuw?<br><br>The boy is possessed.<br>-Yes, for sure. Perhaps that.....<br><br>Now why are you<br>keeping quiet as well?<br><br>Vieuw, hold on, hold on. There<br>is something I want to tell you.<br><br>You're both crazy, right?<br>Watching too much horror movies.<br><br>Ghost!<br><br>Ghost!<br>-Hoy!<br><br>Vieuw! Vieuw! Vieuw!<br>Vieuw, did you see it?<br><br>Where's Dika?<br>-Enough of that. He will surely...<br><br>...turn up soon.<br>-Nonsense! Shortly we'll see...<br><br>...ghosts that are<br>scarier than before!<br><br>Yes, it's eyes were bulging like<br>a guard keeping a secret, right?<br><br>There he is.<br>-Hey!<br><br>Control your breathing<br>if you want to talk!<br><br>How could not have<br>told me there was a ghost!<br><br>It's not that I didn't!<br>I was signaling to you,...<br><br>...you just didn't see the ghost!<br>-How would I know?<br><br>You were doing this.<br>-Did the ghost give chase?<br><br>Who is snoring?<br><br>There's someone<br>in the tent, right?<br><br>Don't tell me<br>it's that ghost.<br><br>Let's check.<br>-I refuse! I don't want to!<br><br>You don't want to?<br>Let's check first! Come on!<br><br>Come quickly! Hurry up!<br><br>How rude. He's just<br>having fun sleeping here.<br><br>In fact, we were looking for him.<br>Then, we were haunted by ghosts.<br><br>Instead he's sleeping here!<br>-Yes, let's just wake him up.<br><br>Hey, hold on! Hold on!<br>-Why?<br><br>I'm not sure<br>this is the real Jono.<br><br>What do you mean?<br>-You forgot I met...<br><br>...the fake Jono just now?<br>I thought that was Jono.<br><br>But it was actually a ghost.<br>-Yes, that's right.<br><br>So, we knock him?<br>-Wait a minute.<br><br>My father once told me,<br>he said if in Thailand,...<br><br>...one can make sure<br>it's a ghost or a person...<br><br>...by using a sock.<br><br>How do you do it?<br>-So, it's like this.<br><br>If I give him my socks,...<br><br>...then,<br>he wrinkles his nose,...<br><br>...that means,<br>he's a real human.<br><br>But if he's just<br>indifferent to it,...<br><br>...that means, he's a ghost.<br><br>Give it go.<br>-All right then. Give it a go.<br><br>Hey, hurry up.<br>-Yes.<br><br>Put the socks near him.<br><br>Enough of that, hurry up.<br><br>Okay, now we knock him.<br>-Hey!<br><br>Hey! You still want to knock him.<br>-Yes, you think he's drum.<br><br>Dika.<br><br>Dika.<br><br>Vieuw, Adit,...<br><br>...do you guys hear that?<br>Someone is calling my name.<br><br>Vieuw.<br><br>I'm being called too.<br><br>Why aren't you being called?<br>-It's fine, it'll be him shortly.<br><br>Yes.<br>-Let's listen.<br><br>One, two, three.<br><br>Oh, yes!<br>Good luck, all right?<br><br>Adit.<br><br>That's bad.<br>-Jackpot.<br><br>You're a goner.<br><br>Please come.<br><br>Adit, Dika,<br>where are we?<br><br>Yes, how did we get here?<br><br>Who's that?<br><br>Vieuw? Dika?<br>-Welcome to my palace.<br><br>You will all be<br>victims of my sacrifice.<br><br>Hey, guys. Wasn't she the one<br>who helped us earlier today?<br><br>Yes, that's right.<br>-She, she, she.....<br><br>She gave us the directions.<br>-Hold on, hold on.<br><br>What business<br>do you have with us?<br><br>Why are we to be<br>made into sacrifice?<br><br>I certainly have<br>no business with you.<br><br>But I have business<br>with your father, Drajat!<br><br>I am his black magic<br>shaman to get rich...<br><br>...until he became successful.<br><br>But now he has<br>broken his promise.<br><br>He no longer<br>gives me any sacrifices.<br><br>Okay, okay.<br>Now I understand.<br><br>All this is definitely<br>my father's fault but...<br><br>...why are my friends going<br>to be sacrifices as well? Why?<br><br>Yes, I will<br>make both of them...<br><br>...slaves here<br>and most importantly,...<br><br>...they will increase<br>the soul of my beauty!<br><br>No, no, no.<br>I beg you, please.<br><br>Please let them go. Let me<br>be the only one who bears...<br><br>...all these curses!<br>Please! Please!<br><br>There's no way we're going...<br><br>...to leave you<br>here by yourself.<br><br>Enough of that, Vieuw, Adit.<br><br>You guys must get out<br>of here, all right?<br><br>Please!<br>-Very well, because...<br><br>...of your sense<br>of solidarity and...<br><br>...your sense of responsibility<br>towards your father,...<br><br>...you two, quickly leave!<br>-Adit, Vieuw, enough.<br><br>No.<br>-You guys must get out of here!<br><br>Enough! Get out of here!<br>-We will not leave...<br><br>...you here by yourself!<br>-Vieuw, listen to me!<br><br>Quickly leave<br>before I change my mind.<br><br>Vieuw?<br>-Adit?<br><br>Vieuw, we were sent back?<br>-Yes.<br><br>But only the two of us<br>that weren't taken.<br><br>Dika? Dika?<br>-Dika? Hey, Dika? Hey!<br><br>You're still here, Dika.<br>-Dika? Wake up, Dika. Dika?<br><br>He can't, Adit. It seems that his<br>soul was sacrificed by the shaman.<br><br>Dika? Wake up, Dika!<br>-Dika?<br><br>Dika? Wake up, Dika.<br>-Dika!<br><br>Gosh! Gosh! Oh, gosh!<br>You guys are so noisy,...<br><br>...disturbing my sleep,<br>I was having a good dream.<br><br>Never expected...<br><br>...Dika would sacrifice<br>his life for his father...<br><br>...and us who<br>are only his friends.<br><br>Yes, Adit.<br>If it wasn't for Dika,...<br><br>...we certainly would have<br>been sacrificed too. Dika? Dika?<br><br>Dika?<br>-Dika? Dika? Dika?<br><br>Gosh! Why are you<br>guys hugging like that?<br><br>You look like Teletubbies.<br><br>Gosh! Why are<br>you guys crying even harder?<br><br>It's making me sad.<br>I will cry as well.<br><br>Please wake up, Dika.<br><br>At exactly 12:00 o'clock,...<br><br>...you will be my sacrifice.<br><br>I've accepted my fate but...<br><br>...just now<br>I saw you dancing.<br><br>You seem to hate<br>and resent something.<br><br>Yes, indeed I hate...<br><br>....the life that<br>I have gone through.<br><br>I hate everyone<br>who has hurt me...<br><br>...and I want<br>everyone to also...<br><br>...feel the same pain as I did.<br><br>Everyone? Including<br>those who are innocent?<br><br>Yes, I don't care.<br>-Actually,...<br><br>...what caused<br>you to feel hatred...<br><br>...towards everyone?<br><br>Way back when,...<br><br>...my father was also a sacrifice.<br><br>My mother died<br>while she was pregnant...<br><br>...and I was born<br>a deformed child.<br><br>Everyone avoided me,...<br><br>...everyone hated me!<br><br>I hate everyone!<br><br>I hate everyone!<br>-But...<br><br>...you look beautiful.<br>You don't look deformed at all.<br><br>Beautiful?<br>You say I'm beautiful?<br><br>Yes, my beauty and...<br><br>...my beautiful body are...<br><br>...the result of my agreement<br>with the Master of Darkness.<br><br>Did you hear that crow?<br><br>That is a sign...<br><br>...that the time has come<br>for me to hand you over...<br><br>...as a sacrifice<br>to the Master of Darkness.<br><br>Dika, take her magic wand...<br><br>...if you want<br>to get out of this place...<br><br>...and return to your body.<br><br>Don't! Don't! Don't!<br><br>Don't!<br>Don't! Don't.....<br><br>Dika?<br>-Dika? Dika!<br><br>Vieuw! Adit!<br>-Dika,...<br><br>...how did you<br>get back into your body?<br><br>It's a long story.<br>Whatever it is, you guys can't...<br><br>...tell anyone, okay?<br><br>We will leave<br>early tomorrow morning.<br><br>O Allah.<br><br>I'm back at this house.<br><br>What's important, you must give<br>that holy water to your father.<br><br>Yes, it can't be<br>put off any longer.<br><br>Oh yes, don't forget.<br>Stomp our feet three times...<br><br>...before we enter the house.<br><br>What does it mean?<br>-Well, I also forgot to ask...<br><br>...what it meant.<br>-Perhaps it's the healing process.<br><br>Yes, perhaps.<br>-All right then.<br><br>Let's do it together.<br><br>Wait.<br><br>Let's do it.<br><br>What's with you?<br>-You said to wait.<br><br>All right then!<br>We'll count, all right?<br><br>On three.<br>One, two, three.<br><br>Okay, give it a go, Vieuw.<br>-Go inside.<br><br>Me?<br>-Yes.<br><br>Why me?<br>-Vieuw, hurry up!<br><br>Well, Vieuw?<br>-How is it?<br><br>Clear.<br>-Oh, all right.<br><br>This is obviously a case of being<br>discarded once no longer useful.<br><br>When their goal was reached,<br>I was pushed aside.<br><br>Not to mention,<br>it's Kliwon night.<br><br>Isn't it creepy?<br><br>There's a woman.<br>I want to seduce her.<br><br>Miss?<br>Are you alone?<br><br>She just kept quiet. Perhaps<br>she's still a virgin, right?<br><br>This is what I meant, Miss.<br><br>If you're still alone,<br>what if we were...<br><br>...went back together?<br>-Sure, Mister.<br><br>It's fine, Miss. If so,<br>I'll go back on my own.<br><br>You're a ghost.<br><br>Ghost!<br><br>What is this?<br>Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!<br><br>Uncle! Be patient, Uncle.<br>-Uncle, Uncle. Be patient, Uncle.<br><br>I've placed the kris in the wall.<br>-Bella, thank you.<br><br>Dika, are you sure<br>this method will work?<br><br>Yes, Bella. I'm very<br>sure this method will work.<br><br>You're all crazy!<br>Let go! Let go! Let go!<br><br>You're all crazy!<br>-Dad, this holy water...<br><br>...will calm you down<br>and not hallucinate anymore.<br><br>You think you know everything!<br>You want to poison your father...<br><br>...so he'll die fast?<br>-Dad, forgive me but I know...<br><br>...you studied the black magic<br>to get rich in Mount Kawi.<br><br>What are you talking about?<br>-Dad, you must drink this.<br><br>Don't want to! Don't want to!<br>-Dad, drink this. Drink, drink.<br><br>Drink it.<br><br>Hot!<br>-Dad? Dad?<br><br>Hot!<br>-Hot?<br><br>Hot!<br>-What's wrong with your father?<br><br>Uncle? Uncle?<br>-Dad?

Let's go.<br><br>Where?<br><br>Where is it?<br>-It was there just now.<br><br>Oh, gosh! There's nothing<br>odd with my stuffed toys.<br><br>Rebecca refuses to<br>believe it when you tell her.<br><br>It's true, just now the stuffed<br>toys were floating over my head...<br><br>...exactly here.<br>-Yes, I believe it, I believe it.<br><br>But couldn't that just<br>have been your imagination?<br><br>For real?<br>-The problem is, I too...<br><br>...felt something weird while<br>I was taking a drink just now.<br><br>I felt as if there was<br>a creature looking at me.<br><br>But there was<br>nothing when I looked.<br><br>Are you for real?<br>You're giving me goosebumps.<br><br>You're scaring me, you know?<br>So, this is what happened.<br><br>I was sitting here.<br>Them, I took a book.<br><br>I was feeling bored.<br>Then, I looked back.<br><br>But the stuffed toys<br>weren't there.

Dad, I'll go in now, okay?<br>-Uncle, be patient, all right?<br><br>What a punk.<br>Who says that no one wants me?<br><br>No one wants me!<br>-Isn't that pathetic?<br><br>I will prove it.<br>I will marry three at once.<br><br>Why is.....<br><br>It's nothing.<br><br>I felt there was a hand.<br><br>What is happening?<br>Why are you screaming?<br><br>What is this?<br>-That.....<br><br>That, that, thingy,.....<br><br>That's the.....<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Thingy, that, that, thingy.<br>The thingy is like that.<br><br>Enough, don't talk<br>back and forth like that.<br><br>Try telling it<br>slowly, all right?<br><br>Don't panic.<br>Inhale, exhale.<br><br>Inhale, exhale.<br><br>Your mouth smells so bad.<br>What did you eat earlier?<br><br>Enough of that, tell me<br>what's the matter, Adit?<br><br>All right then, Uncle.<br>-Yes.<br><br>So, it was like this, all right?<br>I was washing my face...<br><br>...like this.<br>-Yes, like that?<br><br>Then, there was another hand<br>that was rubbing my face here.<br><br>Whose hand was it?<br>-Hold on, hold on.<br><br>You have two hands, right?<br><br>Yes, of course.<br>-So?<br><br>Okay, enough!

You sleep,<br>you're ghost number two.<br><br>I'm not scared<br>of you, all right?<br><br>I have knowledge from<br>my grandpa, able to put...<br><br>...ghosts into bottles.<br>Bottle into a ghost.<br><br>Ghosts into bottles.<br>Watch out, don't play around.<br><br>Yes, this is the bottle.<br><br>Hey, where did it go?<br><br>I'm pretty awesome.<br><br>Uncle Drajat,<br>where are you going?<br><br>Dad? That's odd,<br>you're being neat and clean.<br><br>Bella,<br>I want to apologize...<br><br>...for troubling you<br>all this time, also my rudeness...<br><br>...towards you. Forgive me.<br>-I understand, Uncle.<br><br>But it looks like<br>you're really well now.<br><br>All praise be to Allah.<br><br>Okay,...<br><br>...I'm leaving.<br>Take care of yourself, all right?<br><br>You're leaving?<br>Where are you going, Dad?<br><br>Dika, thank you for<br>your devotion to me,...<br><br>...you too, Bella.<br>You guys have saved me...<br><br>...from a troubled mind,...<br><br>...frustration, stress...<br><br>...hallucinations...<br><br>...and being a crazy person.<br>-Dad,...<br><br>...I love you.<br><br>Whatever I did,<br>it's all for you, Dad.<br><br>Thank you, son.<br>Thank you but...<br><br>...I still have to go.<br><br>You do know that<br>I've allied with Satan...<br><br>...in order to practice black magic<br>to get rich. You know, right?<br><br>Yes, but isn't<br>all that in the past, Dad?<br><br>Yes, but<br>I've made a promise.<br><br>I want to get rid of<br>my sins all this while.<br><br>I want to cleanse<br>my knowledge, cleanse my faith...<br><br>...at the Al-Tauhid<br>Islamic Boarding School.<br><br>Yesterday I spoke to<br>the manager, Kiai Rhoma.<br><br>He was very happy<br>if I could stay there.<br><br>But Dad, I beg you.<br>Please don't go.<br><br>Only with this can I calm...<br><br>...my mind and soul.<br><br>You must know that and<br>you must be strong, all right?<br><br>Very well,<br>may peace be upon you.<br><br>May peace be upon you too.<br><br>May peace be upon you too, Uncle.<br>-Yes.<br><br>I remind you two.<br><br>I have a bad feeling.<br><br>The jinn is not just any jinn.<br><br>It obviously has a reason for<br>coming here, isn't that right?<br><br>So, it's not<br>just stopping by.<br><br>Yes, Dad. No need to<br>think about it, why should you?<br><br>That's the thing!<br>You must know why.<br><br>Before you went to<br>Mount Kawi, this house was clean.<br><br>The minute you returned,<br>a few of such creatures...<br><br>...appeared last night.<br>Isn't that dangerous?<br><br>Your father is right.<br>-Shut up!<br><br>Don't defend my father.<br><br>I'm confused.<br>Indah just called, Dad.<br><br>She said she was<br>terrorized at Rebecca's house.<br><br>What more when it's like that?<br><br>The two of you<br>try to think hard...<br><br>...what did<br>you guys do over there.<br><br>Do you know why the demons<br>have followed you here?<br><br>How is that?<br>Think about it.<br><br>What did your father say?<br><br>I don't know what he said.<br>I didn't understand.<br><br>Isn't that Thai?<br>-Yes, perhaps it's Thai...<br><br>...but I think,<br>it's a regional dialect,...<br><br>...spoken by villagers.<br><br>What?<br><br>Vieuw.<br><br>Dika, you must be proud<br>of your father, right?<br><br>He has a chivalrous soul.<br><br>He wants to cleanse his faith<br>in an Islamic boarding school.<br><br>Of course, Adit.<br>But it's also hard...<br><br>...for me to be<br>separated from my father.<br><br>Yes, hopefully<br>he will be calmer...<br><br>...and his sins<br>will be forgiven by God.<br><br>Amen to that, Brother.<br>-Be strong, Bro.<br><br>It means that now we're<br>the only ones who don't feel calm.<br><br>Not calm?<br>What's the problem?<br><br>We're obviously being<br>terrorized by jinns, right?<br><br>What? Jinns?<br>-Yes, last night...<br><br>...I was washing my face,<br>then all of a sudden,...<br><br>...something was rubbing my brows.<br>-Then, after that,...<br><br>...when Adit and I<br>were fighting over food,...<br><br>...a jinn joined in and<br>Rebecca as well as Indah...<br><br>...were also terrorized<br>at Rebecca's house.<br><br>Not you?<br>-Not you?<br><br>Weird.<br>-Oh, no. Maybe it's the effect...<br><br>...from the holy water<br>and kris that Mbah Kawi gave.<br><br>That's why his house<br>hasn't been bothered by ghosts.<br><br>We'll just sleep at<br>his place now, all right?<br><br>Can't really do that.<br>My father is sure.<br><br>Last night he said that<br>these jinns followed us...<br><br>...from Mount Kawi but<br>why is that so, is what...<br><br>...we must find out the answer.<br><br>Here! How about<br>I give Mbah Kawi a call?<br><br>Perhaps he understand<br>and give us some clues.<br><br>Rebecca, I'll eat first, okay?<br>-All right.<br><br>I'm a healthy kid,<br>my body is strong.<br><br>What are you doing here?<br><br>You ghost!<br>-I'm the ghost!<br><br>Yes, thank you, Mbah.<br><br>Rebecca?<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>No, I'm not doing anything.<br><br>Oh, yes. It seems you and<br>Indah were terrorized by ghosts.<br><br>Yes, last night.<br>That's how it was.<br><br>As of now,<br>we must be more vigilant.<br><br>I just called<br>Mbah Kawi and he said,...<br><br>...one of us...<br><br>...has tried to learn<br>the black magic to get rich.<br><br>Black magic to get rich?<br>-No, just checking.<br><br>Be careful, Adit.<br><br>Why be careful?<br><br>You're being too curious,<br>perhaps eventually you will...<br><br>...do it too.<br>-Of course not.<br><br>Dika,...<br><br>...I'm actually...<br><br>...suspicious about Adit.<br><br>Why are you suspicious?<br><br>So, that day, when<br>I was on the train,...<br><br>...I saw him<br>reading so seriously...<br><br>...about the Mount Kawi's<br>black magic to get rich.<br><br>After I talked to him,<br>he seemed to be acting weird.<br><br>Actually,<br>I'm just feeling scared,...<br><br>...who knows, he secretly was<br>meditating while he was there.<br><br>That's impossible.<br>I've known Adit for a long time.<br><br>When did he meditate?<br>-Well, it could be...<br><br>...while we were<br>sleeping, right?<br><br>But only a few hours<br>isn't enough to meditate.<br><br>It needs several days.<br><br>Yes, that's quite right.<br><br>Yes, but your suspicions<br>are well-founded. Isn't Adit...<br><br>...a person who loves to explore.<br><br>It's best we see him now.<br><br>Let's go.<br>-All right then. Let's go.<br><br>Whatever it is, I want<br>permission to go home. Full-stop!<br><br>Sweetheart, you can't ask for<br>permission just because of that?<br><br>Then what do I do?<br>I can't concentrate on studying.<br><br>Do you know that?<br>Because I'm scared.<br><br>You're not<br>the only one who is scared.<br><br>We're all looking for<br>the solution, all right?<br><br>We all also don't want to<br>be bothered by that jinn.<br><br>All right? Enough of that,<br>Sweetheart. Come here.<br><br>There they are.<br><br>Guys, guys. Where's Adit?<br><br>We must interrogate Adit now.<br><br>Oh, gosh!<br>What's wrong with him?<br><br>But just now I saw him<br>over there carrying a camera.<br><br>Guys! Guys! Guys!<br>-Speak of the Devil.<br><br>Guys, guys.<br>-Hey! Hey! Hey! What is it?<br><br>What is it?<br>-That.<br><br>The jinn followed us to school.<br><br>I've recorded everything.<br>-Adit, Adit. Hold on.<br><br>I want to ask you.<br><br>What have you done at Mount Kawi?<br><br>Done what? Nothing.<br>-Yes, while on the train...<br><br>...I saw you<br>reading so seriously...<br><br>...about the Mount Kawi's<br>black magic to get rich.<br><br>Adit?<br>-You guys are accusing me?<br><br>Enough of that. You better<br>just be honest. It's fine.<br><br>I really wanted<br>to know about Mount Kawi.<br><br>But I was just curious.<br><br>You guys are accusing me?<br><br>Adit? Adit? Adit?<br><br>Dika, you must have<br>proof if you want to talk.<br><br>Oh, no, no, Sweetheart.<br><br>Oh, no, no, no, Sweetheart.<br><br>Adit!<br><br>What are you<br>still doing there?<br><br>What are you doing there?<br>-I'm caressing a gorilla's kid.<br><br>Sweetheart is angry.<br>My sweetheart is angry.<br><br>Ouch! Why did you bite?<br>-Adit! Adit!<br><br>When it comes to ghosts,<br>I am the one to blame.<br><br>Adit! Adit! Wait! Wait first.<br>-What else do you want?<br><br>You want to accuse me again?<br>Just now wasn't enough?<br><br>Hey, Adit. Adit, okay.<br>Okay, I'm sorry, all right?<br><br>Initially,<br>I didn't believe it too.<br><br>But amongst us,<br>there might be a culprit...<br><br>...and this begins with you.<br>-Why me?<br><br>Vieuw? Indah?<br>Rebecca? Then, you.<br><br>How am I<br>to trust you, if actually,...<br><br>...you're not the culprit?<br>-Well,....<br><br>Hold on. It's Mbah Kawi.<br>-Mbah Kawi?<br><br>Yes, Mbah? Hello?<br><br>Just admit it.<br><br>What is this?<br>-Didn't you pick a flower...<br><br>....at Mount Kawi? Correct?<br>-What are you talking about?<br><br>You're talking rubbish.<br>-You know about...<br><br>...the black magic from<br>the article on my laptop, right?<br><br>Enough, it's best you<br>just admit it. We're all calm.<br><br>Gosh! What is it?<br>I didn't do it!<br><br>If you admit it,<br>we promise...<br><br>...we won't be angry, all right?<br>-Yes.<br><br>Okay, I admit it!<br><br>But I just wanted to know...<br><br>...the truth<br>about the myth I read.<br><br>How would I know<br>it would end like this.<br><br>Hold on, hold on.<br>When did you pluck that flower?<br><br>So, you threw<br>accusations at me?<br><br>Adit, I'm so sorry.<br>I was just having fun.<br><br>Yes, having fun<br>is one thing but...<br><br>...perhaps you shouldn't<br>victimize your friend instead.<br><br>I just started to like you.<br><br>But now, it just seems<br>like there's no reason to.<br><br>Adit.<br>-Oh, you guys are here.<br><br>What are you doing here?<br>-Doing what? Doing what?<br><br>Guys, it turns out<br>that all this time...<br><br>...Rebecca has been doing things.<br>-What? Hey!<br><br>Guys, again I'm sorry.<br><br>You two said you wouldn't<br>get angry if I admitted it.<br><br>Okay, okay, okay. Now where<br>is that flower? Give it to me.<br><br>I'm suppose to bury<br>that flower tonight...<br><br>...in the backyard of my house<br>according to the instructions...<br><br>...that I read.<br>-No, no, no. That instruction...<br><br>...is wrong because<br>you stole and kept the flower.<br><br>According to Mbah Kawi's<br>instructions, we must burn it,...<br><br>...then, throw it into the river.<br>-No, whatever it is,...<br><br>...this is my business.<br>-You can't do that!<br><br>Rebecca, but we were terrorized.<br>-How can it be just your business?<br><br>Rebecca, we must burn<br>the flower immediately, all right?<br><br>If we don't,<br>our business will never end.<br><br>I don't want to be<br>constantly bothered by ghosts.<br><br>Rebecca, you really<br>have the heart...<br><br>...to see all of us<br>being terrorized by jinns?<br><br>You don't love us?<br><br>Yes, yes. All right then.<br>-Okay, okay, okay.<br><br>When we go home after school,<br>we'll burn the flower,...<br><br>...then, we'll throw it<br>into the river, okay?<br><br>Guys, once again<br>I'm sorry, all right?<br><br>Yes, it's all right.<br>-It's fine.<br><br>Enough of that.<br>What's important,...<br><br>...you quickly burn the flower.<br>-Yes.<br><br>Give it to me.<br><br>Burn it, burn it,<br>burn it. Burn it.<br><br>Throw it! Throw it!<br>-Toss it!<br><br>Wow!<br>-Wow!<br><br>What?<br>-My time.<br><br>Your time to what?<br>-To shine.<br><br>Wow!<br>-Wow!</div>",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Hantu_Gunung_Kawi-7429260

I'm not sure, corporal.<br><br>How come?<br>I told you just a minute ago!<br><br>I'm telling you again.<br>It's a flash suppresser. You got it?<br><br>Hong Young-soo was a so-called 'torturer'.<br><br>Plus, even his superior just above him in rank<br>has served in the army for over a year,<br><br>which means he'll have his superiors<br>discharged soon and be one himself.<br><br>Repeat after me: flash suppresser.<br>Flash suppresser.

You should salute properly.<br>He's the highest in rank of this squad.<br><br>Sarge, I've come for the change<br>in the request for a day off.<br><br>So In-soo asked for a day off?<br><br>Yes, It's Hak-gyu's turn<br>but he backed down.<br><br>I see. You can go now.<br><br>Yes, sarge. In loyalty we trust!<br><br>Sergeant Choi!<br><br>Isn't In-soo the torturer<br>who had a day off lately?<br><br>Yes, he is.<br><br>He said his mother was ill to take a day off,<br><br>and returned drunk with his girlfriend, you know.<br><br>Damn... So what?<br><br>That wily brat plays<br>his petty tricks all the time.<br><br>You shouldn't take Hak-gyu's day off<br>chance away to send him out, sarge.<br><br>You know Hak-gyu works hard<br>and behaves the best.<br><br>Look, his mother is ill again.<br><br>He's so worried that he can't even sleep.<br>What else could I do?<br><br>And seriously, you believe it, sarge?<br>It's obvious he's going out to meet his girl!<br><br>And Hak-gyu was really looking forward to<br>this day off, you know.<br><br>Look, Hak-gyu can live with it<br>and still do well in the army.<br><br>Cheol-min.<br><br>I've got only 32 days to leave the army.<br><br>What if I don't let this nutcase go<br>and he makes a mess? I can't risk it.<br><br>Take it easy, so this little bro<br>can leave in peace. Will you?<br><br>Big bro Cheol-min?<br><br>I heard you got such nutcase in<br>your squad, too.<br><br>Do not mess with him.<br>You have only a few months to go.<br><br>Relax, you know.<br>Just relax.<br><br>But we shouldn't ignore this<br>as if it's a joke.<br><br>Oh, what the hell! It's time to watch TV.<br>Isn't there a TV break tonight?<br><br>Talk to the daytime duty later.<br><br>Good night, Sergeant Jeong.<br><br>It's mean.<br>A mean, irresponsible thing to say.<br><br>It's not the ones who do their<br>best but the mean cowards that get reward,<br><br>and I should take it for granted?<br><br>Well, let's try one more time.<br>What was this again?<br><br>I'm not sure, corporal.<br><br>Damn! It's a flash suppresser.<br>A flash suppresser, bastard!<br><br>Are you a fool? Huh?<br><br>State your official rank and name!<br><br>Private Hong Young-soo.<br><br>Are you the first sergeant or what?<br>You'd better do it loud and clear.<br><br>From now on, you'll learn<br>everything you need to know from me.<br><br>And we'll do physical training every night.<br>You got it?<br><br>Yes, sarge!<br><br>Work your guts out, bastard.<br>You hear me?<br><br>Yes, sarge!<br><br>Examine it from beginning to end.<br><br>The charging handle, the breech block, the pistol grip,<br><br>the Fla..., the Fla...<br><br>It's the flash suppresser, bastard.<br>You always get stuck there.<br><br>Just like that, whether it was his will or not,<br><br>Young-soo began to adapt himself<br>to life in the army.<br><br>There's a big difference between<br>actions at daytime and nighttime.<br><br>Well then,<br><br>who can tell me what to do respectively when<br>an illuminating shell and a trip flare burst?<br><br>Anyone? No one?<br><br>Even you sergeants are not helping...<br><br>Well then,<br><br>if any private gets the right answer,<br>he'll get a day off next month.<br><br>Private Hong Young-soo!<br><br>Oh, Young-soo.<br>You need to go to the bathroom?<br><br>I'd like to try to answer, sir.<br><br>Uh? Ok then, give it a try.<br><br>When an illuminating shell bursts,<br><br>we grasp the flash suppresser instantly<br>and lie face down, still on the ground.<br><br>When a trip flare bursts,<br>we leave that position immediately.<br><br>Just like that, my little utopia<br>was coming closer to perfection.<br><br>Wake up! Wake up!<br>Fast pace! Fast pace!<br><br>Wake up! Wake up!<br><br>From tomorrow, this company will have<br>a readiness condition exercise.<br><br>Let's go fast! Hurry up!<br><br>Hey, Chang-soo.<br>Bring some camouflage cream.<br><br>Yes, sarge!<br><br>The division commander comes to visit<br>this company's disposal area,<br><br>so let's do this right. You got it?<br><br>Ready? Then get the ammunition boxes first!<br>Fast!<br><br>Go! Hurry up!<br>You bastard lack of discipline...<br><br>Gee...<br>I really had enough of this.<br><br>Well, why is it this company that<br>has to do the sudden exercise, sarge?<br><br>Because the company commander<br>isn't high enough in rank.<br><br>Why else would he make us do this when<br>we're about to take the next cease-fire line shift?<br><br>Maybe he's just anxious to get a promotion.<br><br>If he doesn't make it this time,<br>we're screwed, you know.<br><br>Hope this will be over soon, though.<br><br>I'm not sure.<br>It'll last until lunchtime at least.<br><br>Sergeant Jeong,<br>it's the old man's car!<br><br>Gee...<br>The division commander is coming indeed.<br><br>Let's do this act right.<br><br>This way, sir.<br><br>Squad, attention!<br><br>Present arms!<br>In loyalty we trust!<br><br>Thank you, soldiers.<br>It must be hard to work on this hot day.<br><br>Sergeant Jeong Cheol-min!<br>Not at all, sir!<br><br>Ah, you must be the squad leader.<br><br>Sir, yes, sir!<br><br>Well, I've come all the way here,<br>so let's see how well prepared my soldiers are.<br><br>Give me two soldiers you can count on, sergeant.<br><br>At that very moment,<br>I figured out what would be the safest.<br><br>May I recommend myself, the leader,<br><br>and private Hong Young-soo,<br>the latest newcomer of this squad, sir?<br><br>Well, good. The highest and the lowest in rank,<br>that should be enough.<br><br>Second Company Commander,<br>examine their field packs.<br><br>First Lieutenant Kim Jeong-ho!<br>Yes, sir!<br><br>Well, you did pack very thoroughly.<br><br>Now, let's see the newcomer's pack.<br><br>Do it properly, bastards!<br><br>You bastards lack of discipline.<br>Who says you can move?<br><br>When the company commander<br>looked uneasily at me,<br><br>I smiled with confidence.<br><br>But in Hong Young-soo's pack,<br><br>there were only two bear suits,<br>hardtack and plastic bags filled with air.<br><br>Hmm...<br><br>You brats!<br><br>- Hey. Shut the door.<br>- Yes, sarge.<br><br>- Hong Young-soo.<br>- Private Hong Young-soo!<br><br>Shut up! You son of a bitch!<br><br>From now on, you can't state<br>your rank and name.<br><br>Hey, was the full pack that heavy?<br>Huh?<br><br>Fucking bastard ...I thought you're stupid<br>but you must be quite smart. Huh?<br><br>I'd never thought of such thing.<br>You fucking bastard!<br><br>Hands down, bastard!<br>Does it hurt? Huh? Does this hurt?<br><br>You can feel the pain but don't know<br>others can as well, bastard?<br><br>You scumbag...<br><br>So you don't care about others<br>as long as you don't suffer?<br><br>You're comfortable, and that's it?<br>Fucking bastard!<br><br>I hate guys like you the most.<br>You scumbag!<br><br>Don't do anything, anymore.<br>You're not a human being anymore.<br><br>Do not state your rank and name.<br>Do not work!<br><br>Don't do anything, bastard!<br><br>Corporal Lee!

We're fucked up!<br><br>- What happens now?<br>- We're fucked up!<br><br>Sergeant Jeong,<br>the company commander wants you.<br><br>Hey, did Hong Young-soo really die?<br><br>No, sarge.<br>He made a suicide attempt but failed.<br><br>Shit...<br>Tell me in more detail.<br><br>Young-soo was supposed to do<br>his guard duty with Chang-soo,<br><br>so I woke him up and he went<br>to the bathroom, but didn't come out.<br><br>I went in to the stall next to him to have a look<br>and found him down,<br><br>his wrist slit with a cutter.<br><br>Slit his wrist? How badly?<br><br>The cut didn't look so deep.<br><br>At first glance I was too shocked to notice it,<br>but he didn't bleed much.<br><br>That bastard made a feint!<br><br>You've contacted the battalion<br>over such trifling matter? Crazy bastard!<br><br>I'm very sorry, sir.<br>I was too shocked earlier...<br><br>In loyalty we trust!<br>Sergeant Jeong Chul...<br><br>Ah, Chul-min.<br>Come on over.<br><br>We need to get our story straight<br>before the battalion commander arrives.<br><br>It's not even a suicide anyway.<br><br>Young-soo has been always weird.<br><br>We should tell the commander<br>how weird he has been, in detail.<br><br>For example, that he used to be shaking<br>with fear when seeing a gun,<br><br>or was rude when talking to his superior.<br><br>Something like that,<br>adding a bit on it.<br><br>And leave out the get-downs<br>I gave in the evening.<br><br>Yes, sir.<br><br>How is he?<br><br>In royalty we trust!<br>The wound is not a big deal, sir.<br><br>Then why is he still unconscious?<br><br>I'm not sure, sir.<br>It must be the shock.<br><br>In royalty we trust!<br><br>Commander,<br>the battalion commander has arrived.<br><br>I see.<br><br>Hey you, medic!<br>Come with me and explain the situation.<br><br>Yes, sir!<br><br>Hey, Hong Young-soo.<br>I know you're awake.<br><br>Get up.<br><br>Do you really have to do this?<br><br>Oh my...<br>This strange new guy is really a pain in the neck.<br><br>Cheol-min, you must have gone through<br>a lot because of Young-soo.<br><br>If he was directly under my control,<br>I'd have made a real soldier of him.<br><br>Given the job,<br>you must have had a hard time.<br><br>He did, sir. Sergeant Jeong really did<br>his best to train this guy...<br><br>- Keep still, commander.<br>- Oh...<br><br>So, Cheol-min.<br><br>Why didn't you teach him a tiny lesson<br>when he wasn't listening to you? Huh?<br><br>Like tapping him on the head,<br>to make him listen, you know.<br><br>You should've tried it. Huh?<br><br>I did try sometimes but...<br><br>Oh, you did?<br>You used to tap him on his head or so?<br><br>Sometimes, when he wasn't<br>listening to the order.<br><br>Well, I see.<br>So you did.<br><br>Second Company Commander,<br>arrest him immediately!<br><br>Who the hell are you, commander?<br><br>You don't have a clue or what?<br><br>Yes, I have, sir.<br><br>A matter like this need to be punished<br>severely as a warning to others.<br><br>We'll eradicate beatings and harsh treatment<br>from the army this time.<br><br>Second Company Commander!<br>Do not let this bastard sleep!<br><br>Question him thoroughly until you find out<br>how he did it and make a full report!<br><br>Yes, sir!<br>I'll report after a full investigation.<br><br>I knew you bastard would make trouble.<br><br>Twenty hours...<br>And I've been saying the same thing over again.<br><br>- Maybe it wasn't the same thing.<br>- You drank and enjoyed everything you could, bastard.<br><br>- I can't remember at all what I said a moment ago.<br>- Just talk and get through with this. You get it?<br><br>I must have been endlessly repeating<br>to myself, ""I'm a fool.""<br><br>Are you not answering me?<br>Where's this confident Jeong I know? Huh?<br><br>- Hong Young-soo's attempted suicide...<br>- After 35 hours of questioning, a week went by.<br><br>The cause of Private Hong Young-soo's<br>attempted suicide<br><br>The whole story goes like this.<br><br>The whole story goes like this.<br><br>Hong Young-soo got just transferred,<br>having a hard time to adapt himself to the army.<br><br>The reason is that the squad room,<br>unlike others, has no windows,<br><br>which makes it easy to avoid<br>surveillance of the superiors.<br><br>Therefore, it has been difficult<br>to prevent beatings from occurring,<br><br>and it appears having late-night snacks<br><br>and drinking against rules<br>have happened openly.<br><br>More crucially, on the day of<br>Hong Young-soo's attempted suicide,<br><br>Squad Leader Jeong Cheol-min<br>had beaten Hong in front of the squad members.<br><br>Additionally, Hong Young-soo's superior, Lee Chang-soo,<br><br>has been beating Hong habitually at place of duty.<br><br>As the punishment for such behaviors,<br><br>Sergeant Jeong Cheol-min<br>and Corporal Lee Chang-soo<br><br>will be put into jail for 15<br>and 10 days respectively.<br><br>The rest of the squad will be sent<br>to the discipline camp for 7 days.<br><br>Second Company, Second Platoon,<br>First Squad will be dissolved and reorganized.<br><br>One.<br><br>Two.<br><br>Three.<br><br>In a place where time passes even<br>more slowly than in the boot camp,<br><br>I've thought over for 15 days<br>whose sin I am actually paying for.<br><br>When I got back after<br>paying for someone else's sin,<br><br>a small, newly-made window<br>greeted me mockingly.<br><br>In my place that has turned into<br>a strangers' paradise,<br><br>I lied like a dead body<br>and spent the remaining days of my army life.<br><br>Oh, Well...<br><br>Now you are getting discharged,<br>Cheol-min.<br><br>It must have been very disappointing<br>to see others of your rank leaving in time.<br><br>If this strange new guy had not come<br>at the last moment...<br><br>I have him as my orderly man now,<br><br>and he's so irritating to drive me crazy,<br>you know.<br><br>My luck in having good men<br>comes and goes, I guess.<br><br>Well then,<br>just forget all what happened here<br><br>and go out into the world to try your best.<br><br>You were the best even in the army,<br>Cheol-min.<br><br>Unit, attention!<br>Salute to the commander!<br><br>In loyalty we trust!<br><br>I'm getting discharged.<br><br>Let me ask you one thing.<br><br>You...<br>Do you feel comfortable now?<br><br>I'm off.<br>Take care.<br><br>It's...<br><br>Uh...?<br><br>It...

Here, for example,<br>people can still see each other.<br><br>You can see that the houses<br>are built in the same style.<br><br>I do think it's a pity<br>we couldn't hang our curtain here.<br><br>It would've been so much clearer:<br>radio, TV, and germs crossing the border.<br><br>I didn't make it up: the love stories,<br>the bipartisan energy deals, it's all real.<br><br>So, that's what<br>I've been concentrating on,<br><br>all these things and the slogans.<br><br>Other cities have graffiti too,<br>but here it's especially significant.<br><br>It turns the Wall<br>into a sort of bulletin board.<br><br>Now that they're making the Wall<br>higher, whiter and nicer all the time,<br><br>it's like they're asking for graffiti.<br><br>Well, that's one way I look at my city.<br><br>I would like to choose the photos<br>according to two main criteria.<br><br>First: alternative publicity.<br><br>It's important that large photos<br>that you wouldn't get to see otherwise<br><br>are shown all over the city.<br><br>Certain groups<br>can't express their views on billboards.<br><br>Grassroots movements<br>have no advertising budget.<br><br>They do have a message, like any company,<br>but could never pay for a billboard.<br><br>But the public's always<br>participated in this.<br><br>Those slogans are made by the public.<br><br>So the public's on our side.<br>We just have to make that clear.<br><br>This looks as though<br>only the GDR was walled in.<br><br>But if you look at a map,<br><br>you'll see that the wall<br>is really around us.<br><br>So it's us who live in a prison<br>and are subsidized<br><br>because it's in the interests<br>of capitalism or America<br><br>that West Berlin exists.<br><br>That's why we're allowed to leave<br>this prison every now and then.<br><br>We should be prepared<br>for the project being rejected.<br><br>We should think<br>about what to do if it is.<br><br>After all, it's expensive<br>to enlarge the photos and hang them up.<br><br>And if they reject the project,<br>what do we do?<br><br>The work will have been paid for,<br><br>but we're not doing this for ourselves.<br>We want to reach the public...<br><br>I want to know<br>how people will react if we enlarge them.<br><br>But that's not the question.<br><br>People will look at the photos<br>once they're up there.<br><br>But how do we get them up<br>on the billboards?<br><br>Will they allow us to put them up?<br><br>I don't think it makes sense<br>to go on speculating.<br><br>We should stick to our concept<br>and be as clear as possible.<br><br>And if it fails...<br><br>- I don't think it will.<br>- Let's risk it...<br><br>We can either take the bull by the horns<br>or just give up.<br><br>Not just on this project,<br>but also professionally.<br><br>- I agree.<br>- That's too pessimistic.<br><br>They won't let us<br>spoil their image of Berlin.<br><br>The pictures are harmless,<br>but in context...<br><br>- I'm afraid they'll ban the photos.<br>- I don't think they can do that.<br><br>Here.

sorry about this.<br><br>Sri.<br><br>I never hesitated to take responsibility<br>by marrying you.<br><br>I just don't feel capable<br>of being a good father for our child.<br><br>And I need to figure it out, Sri.<br><br>I don't want to be trapped<br>in the box of memories<br><br>made of prejudices.<br><br>Believe me.<br><br>I will be back soon.<br><br>Pur, come here.<br><br>Can you stay<br>and eat this soto with me again?<br><br>Here at the inn...<br><br>I'm waiting for two things...<br><br>that haven't arrived yet.<br><br>First, my wife.<br><br>Second...<br><br>is your cooking.<br><br>It is indeed...<br><br>not easy...<br><br>to forget and to let go of someone<br>who has left.<br><br>Indeed.<br><br>Are you talking about me, Uncle?<br><br>Both of us.<br><br>I also lost my child in a car accident.<br><br>In fact, at that time,<br><br>my wife didn't allow me to take our child,<br>Cempaka, to his lesson.<br><br>Because she knew...<br><br>I was sleepy and very tired.<br><br>But I didn't listen to her.<br><br>It is not easy...<br><br>to forgive a person...<br><br>who made you suffer.<br><br>Even when that person<br>is suffering just as much.<br><br>Perhaps...<br><br>this isn't about us...<br><br>with the other person.<br><br>This is about us with ourselves.<br><br>Perhaps what we need...<br><br>is to forgive ourselves.<br><br>Please!<br><br>- How was it?<br>- It was fun!<br><br>Here.<br><br>- Take this.<br>- What is this?<br><br>Your commission.<br><br>- Are you sure?<br>- I am.<br><br>- This is too much.<br>- Tarjo.<br><br>Don't ever ask my son<br>to do useless things like this again.<br><br>- Give it to me!<br>- But, Mom...<br><br>He's not here for some cash.<br><br>- Come!<br>- Mom...<br><br>I'm disappointed staying here.<br><br>We offer our apology<br>if something upsets you...<br><br>You should just stick to running the inn<br><br>and don't intervene<br>in other family's affairs.<br><br>I'm sorry if you feel that way,<br>Mrs. Angga.<br><br>But if you feel disappointed<br>and dissatisfied,<br><br>you have the right as a guest.<br><br>However, allow me to explain this.<br><br>We, the Brotos,<br><br>had never intervened<br>in our guests' private matters.<br><br>In fact, our guests come here<br>with their own problems.<br><br>But my son was dutiful before coming here.<br><br>Look, Mrs. Angga.<br><br>It's not wrong if we feel concerned<br><br>and try to give attention.<br><br>That's part of our spirit<br>in developing the inn.<br><br>We don't need your concern.<br><br>It is me that have concern<br>over your family.<br><br>You're too nosy about our family<br><br>when your own family have problems.<br><br>None of your children<br>even graduated college.<br><br>Mom!<br><br>I don't want to go to college.<br><br>I want to be like Tarjo.<br><br>Raffell, I'm nobody right now.<br><br>I have yet to prove<br>that I can live by my choice.<br><br>If you want to be understood by others,<br><br>you should understand them first.<br><br>You should understand your mother.<br><br>Come on, son.<br><br>Mother.<br><br>You're right, Tarjo.<br><br>You must understand people first<br>before expecting them to understand you.<br><br>Now, you must understand me.<br><br>Atmo!<br><br>- Yes, Ma'am.<br>- Get Sri and Pur to come here.<br><br>Yes, Ma'am.<br><br>Look, Pur.<br><br>How did it end up being so expensive?<br><br>I've already set the operational budget.<br><br>I already followed your budget, Mother.<br><br>So how did it come to a deficit?<br><br>Because your budget was actually too low.<br><br>The price of groceries has increased.<br><br>Some have even doubled.<br><br>You didn't inform me.<br><br>What do you mean?<br><br>I do inform you every time,<br>but you never listened.<br><br>You just told me to manage somehow.<br><br>So, this is the result of your management?<br><br>Yes, Mother.<br><br>If I didn't manage it,<br>the deficit would've been more.<br><br>Why don't you go ask Sri?<br><br>Maybe she can help you with this.<br><br>Sri?<br><br>It's always Sri.<br><br>She's smarter,<br><br>braver.<br><br>- She understands things better.<br>- Pur!<br><br>Don't be too sensitive.<br>It's about the inn.<br><br>I'm not, Mother.<br><br>She's the reason my report has a deficit.<br><br>- What?<br>- I've suggested to you,<br><br>to Father,<br><br>and Sri too,<br><br>to give a limited options of menu<br>for the guests.<br><br>Two or three options every day.<br><br>But what did Sri say?<br><br>""It's okay to let them choose anything.<br><br>That's what makes us different<br>from other inns<br><br>and raises our service to the top.""<br><br>She's right, though.<br><br>She has a point.<br><br>You're right, Mother.<br><br>Fix this, I don't accept it.<br><br>Yes, Mother.<br><br>Excuse me.<br><br>I'm sorry, Sis.<br><br>Frankly, I was jealous of you.<br><br>You had Anton, he was such a good person.<br><br>He loved you so much.<br><br>- That's why...<br>- Enough.<br><br>That's why I insisted<br>he picked me up that night.<br><br>I got so annoyed when he didn't show up.<br><br>- I thought you didn't allow him...<br>- He died because of me!<br><br>He got into that accident because of me!<br><br>It's okay, I got this.<br><br>- You don't have to.<br>- Just go and pick up Sri.<br><br>What about Tarjo?<br><br>He is too tired after taking the guests<br>to Parangtritis.<br><br>I see. Alright, then.<br><br>The fish will be done cooking in a minute.<br><br>Yes, Sire.<br><br>Drive safely.<br><br>- Pur...<br>- What is it?<br><br>Why don't we get married?<br><br>Stop it!<br><br>- You're already late.<br>- What do you say?<br><br>Let's talk about it later.<br><br>Go! The fish will get burnt!<br><br>I'm sure it will wait for you.<br><br>Just go already!<br><br>- Drive safely.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- Come on.<br>- Let's go.<br><br>I'm home, Mother, Father.<br><br>Sri, I don't like what you're wearing.<br><br>I was waiting for Anton,<br>but he never showed up.<br><br>We've been waiting for you.<br><br>Waiting for me or Pur's fish dish?<br><br>ANTON<br><br>Now Anton is calling.<br><br>Yes?<br><br>I thought...<br><br>I could have peace if I made you<br>the cause of his death.<br><br>That I could let him go.<br><br>But it doesn't turn out that way.<br><br>I haven't even answered his last question.<br><br>Yes, Anton.<br><br>I want to marry you.<br><br>Actually, I'm jealous of you too.<br><br>He really loved you.<br><br>Sis...<br><br>He always reminded me<br>to be a good sister for you...<br><br>to always support you.<br><br>Even though I know<br>you don't need support from anybody.<br><br>You're great.<br><br>You have a gift.<br><br>You can win anything.<br><br>You can be number one in school.<br><br>And win singing contests.<br><br>I'm pregnant.<br><br>It's two months along.<br><br>Did Jarot know about it?<br><br>He left after I told him.<br><br>I've been abandoned.<br><br>He abandoned me.<br><br>So how long are you keeping it a secret?<br><br>This is delicious.<br><br>Mother, Father.<br><br>Sri has something to say.<br><br>What do you want to say? About Jarot?<br><br>He's already gone.<br><br>Let's eat first before we talk<br>about some serious matters.<br><br>Atmo! Get Tarjo to join us for dinner.<br><br>- Honey.<br>- He's at the campus, Sir.<br><br>- He's right.<br>- At this hour?<br><br>Come on, honey.<br><br>Leave some for Tarjo.<br><br>- Yes, Ma'am.<br>- You can join us, Atmo.<br><br>This is a delicious duck dish<br>Yudhistira gave us.<br><br>- I think he has a thing for you, Sri.<br>- Honey.<br><br>Listen, honey.<br><br>She deserves to get a better one,<br>don't you think?<br><br>Knock it off.<br><br>Dig in, Pur.<br><br>Sri.

Sad Vacation (2007) - full transcript,"<p class=""plot"">Kenji, abandoned by his mother, scrapes out a meager existence doing odd jobs including driving bar hostesses and their customers home. Besides this he takes care of the sister of an old friend in jail and a young illegal immigrant. But his life reaches a turning point when he happens to meet Chiyoko, his long lost mother.

Where will it ultimately lead them?</p>","<div class=""full-script"">

Where are you going?<br><br>Yusuke!<br><br>That brat!<br>He's an embarrassment!<br><br>What's wrong?<br><br>Yuri! What's the matter?<br><br>Oh God.<br><br>Was it Yusuke?<br><br>Did he do this to you?<br><br>Tell me, Yuri!<br>What happened?<br><br>Yuri, please!<br>Snap out of it!<br><br>Something wrong?<br><br>Yusuke ran off.<br><br>Seriously?<br><br>He was probably waiting<br>for us to leave.<br><br>Shall I go on without you?<br><br>Will you be alright on your own?<br><br>Well I'll pull over if I get tired.<br><br>Ah...<br><br>sorry about this.<br><br>Welcome back.<br>Long drive to take alone.<br><br>Is the boss in?<br><br>No, he's out looking for Yusuke.<br><br>What's more I'm afraid I have<br>some bad news for you.<br><br>- Whisky?<br>- No, I'm fine.<br><br>The thing is, soon after Yusuke left,<br>we found Yuri collapsed on the floor.<br><br>Yuri?<br><br>Though I had my license revoked,<br>I was once a doctor, you know.<br><br>So I had a look at her.<br><br>She was raped.<br><br>She's not there.<br>She's gone.<br><br>Chiyoko took her back<br>to the facility.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Welcome home.<br><br>I'm impressed.<br><br>About what?<br><br>You lived with Yuri all this time<br>and nothing ever happened.<br><br>Huh?<br><br>You never laid a hand on her.<br><br>I worried about that.<br><br>I thought she might wake up one day<br>and find herself pregnant.<br><br>And if she did?<br><br>Well, that would be fine, too.<br><br>Even if the child was like her.<br><br>We have this big house.<br><br>We could all live happily here.<br><br>Of course, you'd need a good wife.<br><br>Someone proper enough<br>to run the household.<br><br>She'd have to be someone who could<br>give you all the support you needed.<br><br>You're a piece of work.<br><br>What do you mean?<br><br>I went to that fancy restaurant<br>you once worked at.<br><br>One of the staff there<br>still remembers you.<br><br>I laughed hearing about all<br>the customers you slept with.<br><br>Searching for anyone<br>that would have you.<br><br>This lady on the staff...<br><br>mustn't have liked you much.<br><br>She had a lot of<br>negative things to say.<br><br>I don't see how you chose a<br>good man like Mr. Mamiya.<br><br>That just doesn't suit you at all,<br>does it?<br><br>You must've duped him good.<br><br>- Where were you the day before yesterday?<br>- What's it to you?<br><br>- You have a girlfriend?<br>- I said, what's it to you?<br><br>I have to meet my future<br>daughter-in-law.<br><br>Are you nuts?<br><br>Yusuke's gone.<br><br>I've got to make sure you can<br>comfortably take over the business now.<br><br>What world do you live in?<br><br>This one.<br><br>Come on, Kenji.<br>You're the heir, here.<br><br>Don't make me laugh.<br>Who would want to live here?<br><br>I planned it all.<br>I gave Yusuke his bike key.<br><br>I even figured he'd go after Yuri.<br><br>But that was fine as long as you felt<br>what it's like to be abandoned.<br><br>I did what I came to do.<br>I've no other use for this place.<br><br>And now I'm out of here.<br>Have a nice life.<br><br>You can't leave, Kenji.<br><br>Kenji!<br><br>You were never my mother, got it?<br><br>Will you still have me?<br><br>I told you I'd wait.<br><br>Yuri's in a nursing facility.<br><br>Then bring her here.<br><br>I'll go check in on her.<br><br>Guess what?<br><br>I'm pregnant.<br><br>- Hello.<br>- Thanks for seeing me.<br><br>Have a seat.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Your mother paid a visit yesterday.<br><br>Oh, I see.<br><br>She...<br><br>wants to adopt Yuri.<br><br>That's news to me.<br><br>I see.<br><br>Either way, Yuri's not ready<br>to be released yet.<br><br>Oh, I see.<br><br>I'll call you when she is.<br><br>I'd appreciate that.<br><br>So...<br><br>Which address should I contact you at?<br><br>Mamiya or Shiraishi?<br><br>Shiraishi.<br><br>Can you support her?<br><br>I think so, yes.<br><br>Mr. Shiraishi...<br><br>Yuri is very unstable right now.<br><br>I don't expect men to understand.<br><br>But you don't go back to normal<br>after what she's been through.<br><br>Understand?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>So I'm asking you.<br>Can you care for her properly?<br><br>Can you really take responsibility for her?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>What do you want?<br><br>To kill you.<br><br>If you want to hate someone,<br>hate your mum.<br><br>Mom would hate to see us<br>killing each other.<br><br>Isn't that what you want?<br><br>That slut is no longer<br>relevant to me.<br><br>You call your own mother a slut?<br><br>Give it up.<br>You can't win.<br><br>Enough.<br><br>Run home.<br>Stop worrying your dad.<br><br>What's the matter?<br>What is it?<br><br>Please calm down!<br><br>Damn you!<br><br>Hey!<br><br>Get up.<br><br>Hey!<br><br>Not getting up?<br><br>Shit!<br><br>Huh!<br><br>It's Kenji!<br><br>Who's Kenji?<br><br>Rest in peace.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Is

Gotoh?<br><br>There's no one by that name here.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>May I ask who's calling?<br><br>It's sure getting cold.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Looking after yourself?<br><br>- Yes.<br>- We lucked out! The newspaper...<br><br>Shut up!<br><br>Doesn't matter.<br><br>We found Kozue and she's happy.<br>That's enough.<br><br>Way to go.<br><br>This doesn't seem to be<br>such a bad place either, right?<br><br>Lots of people here like you, Shigeo.<br><br>Huh! That would suck.<br><br>What's that supposed to mean, apologize!<br><br>- Shigeo.<br>- Yes, what?<br><br>Come and meet everybody.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Sure was a bizarre<br>coincidence though.<br><br>Wasn't it?<br><br>Chiyoko, could you say a word<br>to everyone?<br><br>Let me introduce you to<br>Ms. Saeko Shiina.<br><br>Kenji's fiancee.<br><br>Oh, I see.

thanks.<br><br>What's your name?<br><br>- [Jack] Jack.<br><br>- Jack.<br><br>- [Jack] Yes, like<br>Jack the Ripper.<br><br>- Funny.<br><br>So you got a story for me, Jack?<br><br>- [Jack] I do, but the truth is<br><br>that I prefer to look at<br>you telling the stories.<br><br>- Look at me telling stories?<br><br>- [Jack] Yeah, I'm<br>watching you right now.<br><br>You look very pretty.<br><br>- Let's see, which<br>eye did I just blink,<br><br>right or left, Jack?<br><br>- [Jack] I cannot see<br>that from where I am.<br><br>- Hm, yeah, right.<br><br>Wait, you sent me a<br>gift today, right?<br><br>- I did and I'm<br>glad you liked it.<br><br>- How do you know I liked it?<br><br>- [Jack] Because you're<br>wearing it right now, love.<br><br>Am I wrong?<br><br>[ominous music]<br><br>- I'm sorry, but you're wrong.<br><br>What's your story?<br><br>- [Jack] Are you sure<br>you're not wearing it, love?<br><br>- Okay, I'm bored.<br><br>Thanks for dialing in.<br><br>Asshole.<br><br>[melancholy music]<br><br>[machine whirring]<br><br>- I gotta unpack everything<br>and I'm pretty beat.<br><br>You guys have fun.<br><br>All right, I'll see<br>you guys

to you.<br><br>- [Bob] It did.<br><br>- If it took place in your<br>dreams, it doesn't count.<br><br>But thanks for dialing in.<br><br>It's almost two<br>o'clock in the morning.<br><br>We got another call.<br><br>Who's there?<br><br>- [Jack] Hi, my sweet Candy.<br><br>It's me.<br><br>- Again.<br><br>- [Jack] Well, you just didn't<br>let me finish telling you<br><br>what I wanted to say.<br><br>- I ain't got no time for this.<br><br>You got a story or not?<br><br>- [Jack] Of course I do.<br><br>- So tell it.<br><br>- [Jack] It happened<br>a month ago.<br><br>The main character is<br>a young pretty girl<br><br>with many friends and<br>an interesting job.<br><br>- I said the story<br>gotta be personal.<br><br>- [Jack] Be patient,<br>my Candy sweet.<br><br>- Okay, go on.<br><br>- [Jack] It turns<br>out that this girl<br><br>goes to a bar with some<br>girlfriends from work.<br><br>The place was packed that night.<br><br>A guy tries to buy her a drink.<br><br>She says no, but he insists<br>and she finally agrees.<br><br>And then she chooses the<br>most luxurious drink.<br><br>They have a fancy French<br>wine, hugely expensive.<br><br>He spends half of his<br>salary inviting her.<br><br>So she tells him, ""Wait here,<br>I'm going to the toilet.""<br><br>He stays there and the<br>girl is not coming back.<br><br>Then he sees her leaving the<br>bar with her girlfriends,<br><br>sharing the wine among<br>them, laughing really hard.<br><br>Nasty, isn't it?<br><br>And the worst part<br><br>is that she probably doesn't<br>even remember him now.<br><br>- I think she does remember<br>Jack, and she regrets it.<br><br>She was probably drunk<br>and wouldn't do it again.<br><br>- [Jack] You think so?<br><br>Maybe.<br><br>What if the guy wasn't<br>as dumb as she thought?<br><br>Imagine if she humiliated<br>the wrong person.<br><br>What if the girl is doomed<br>and she doesn't even know it?<br><br>Interesting, right?<br><br>- Look man, I think the<br>guy should get over it.<br><br>It wasn't such a big deal,<br>but thanks for dialing in.<br><br>- [Jack] You better not<br>hang up on me, love.<br><br>- What did you just say?<br><br>- [Jack] I said, don't even<br>think of hanging up on me.<br><br>- Bye, Jack ass.<br><br>I call the shots here.<br><br>Let's cut to the commercials.<br><br>Stay there folks.<br><br>- [Announcer] I play<br>guitar and when I play,<br><br>I like to turn up the juice.<br><br>So I rock with the<br>real fruit juice taste<br><br>in Bubble Yum bubble gum's new<br><br>Hawaiian punch fruit punch,<br>wet and wild watermelon,<br><br>and strawberry stripe.<br><br>Their full face taste<br>keeps my jaws jamming<br><br>and their blasting<br>bubbles out of my lips<br><br>like my fingers<br>cross this guitar.<br><br>Bubble Yum has three new flavors<br><br>with real fruit juice taste.<br><br>You gotta like<br>the sound of that.<br><br>Bubble Yum keeps it-<br><br>[intense music]<br><br>[ominous

been condemned.<br><br>- That's okay.<br><br>I'm just glad you could<br>show me the place.<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>Well, follow me.<br><br>Watch your stop there, please.<br><br>[rats squealing]<br><br>We're just gonna<br>go through here.<br><br>- Oh, okay.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Okay, so this is it.<br><br>The crown jewel of Wavel Hill.<br><br>Built in 1827,<br><br>just five years before the<br>cholera epidemic of 1832.<br><br>[door slamming]<br><br>- It's charming.<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>So of course, uh,<br>the power is off.<br><br>So is the heat.<br><br>Um, the city just can't afford<br>to keep the boilers running.<br><br>But we can turn that<br>all back on for you<br><br>if you choose to use<br>this in your movie.<br><br>- Yeah, no worries.<br><br>I like it just the way it is.<br><br>- Good.<br><br>Okay, well uh, we<br>should get going.<br><br>If you'll just,<br>uh, come with me.<br><br>[animal footsteps pattering]<br><br>Each nurse would be in charge<br>of one

huge.<br><br>- [Sarah] Uh yeah.<br><br>Three wards,<br>500,000 square feet,<br><br>and enough equipment to treat<br>hundreds of sick patients.<br><br>- [Chad] It doesn't<br>look that old<br><br>for something built<br>almost 200 years ago.<br><br>- Oh, well the<br>building has gradually<br><br>been renovated over the years.<br><br>I mean, up until the county<br>closed at 32 years ago.<br><br>We're gonna go in here.<br><br>[tense music]<br><br>- And what happened here?<br><br>- Um, nothing you didn't<br>show in your movies,<br><br>Mr. Winchester.<br><br>- Oh, so you're<br>familiar with my work?<br><br>- Yeah, a little bit.<br><br>- Got guts.<br><br>[door slamming]<br><br>- [Sarah] You know,<br><br>this institution<br>helped a lot of people.<br><br>- [Chad] I heard<br>they weren't always<br><br>that helpful here.<br><br>- [Sarah] Yeah, well it's like<br>my dad used to always say,<br><br>""You can't make an omelet<br>without cracking a few eggs.""<br><br>- [Chad] Yeah, I guess.<br><br>[tense music]<br><br>Oh yeah.<br><br>Welcome to the asylum.<br><br>I'm just gonna get some<br>video footage here, okay?<br><br>- [Sarah] Yeah, yeah.<br><br>- Okay, let's do this.<br><br>Hello to my future self.<br><br>To the producers<br>watching this with me.<br><br>Hello.<br><br>Oh, hi mom.<br><br>I'm standing in one of the<br>freakiest places I've seen<br><br>in a very long time.<br><br>Wavel Hill Sanitarium,<br>West Virginia.<br><br>Fortunately not everything<br>is so depressing down here.<br><br>Hey, it's grandma's upholstery.<br><br>So according to a friend<br>of a friend of mine<br><br>who lives in the county,<br><br>Wavel Hill Sanitarium<br>became infamous<br><br>for its atrocious experiments<br>conducted on the patients<br><br>between around 1925 to 1928.<br><br>The most popular case is<br>the one of a Mary Weaver.<br><br>It's even said<br><br>that Mary's ghost still<br>roams these corridors,<br><br>searching for something.<br><br>[laughs] Classic.<br><br>Hey, there she is.<br>[tense music]<br><br>- Come on, this way.<br><br>So according to the<br>medical archives,<br><br>Mary was in room 502,<br><br>which should be at the<br>end of this corridor.<br><br>Ah, here it is.<br><br>- Oh, this is great.<br><br>Oh, wow.<br><br>Oh my God.<br><br>Even the cheesiest horror flick<br><br>wouldn't have<br>something this obvious.<br><br>Oh this, this is good stuff.<br><br>Did you do this for me?<br><br>- [Sarah] Don't<br>flatter yourself.<br><br>- [Chad] Here, give<br>you a hand with this.<br><br>- [Sarah] Okay.<br><br>[metal clanking]<br>[ominous music]<br><br>- I can't wait to<br>see what's inside.<br><br>[door banging]<br><br>Well that sucks.<br><br>- Well, I don't know<br>what you were hoping for.<br><br>- I don't know,<br>something sexier.<br><br>Can you introduce<br>yourself to the camera?<br><br>- Uh, hi, I'm Sarah Davis.<br><br>I work for the County of<br>Tucker, West Virginia.<br><br>- [Chad] Tell us where we are.<br><br>- Uh, we are in room 502<br>of Wavel Hill Sanitarium.<br><br>- [Chad] Can you explain<br><br>to the people watching this<br><br>why I so very badly<br>wanted to come here?<br><br>- Ah, uh, because of the<br>story of Mary Weaver.<br><br>- [Chad] And what is that?<br><br>- Back in 1927, the body<br>of nurse Mary Weaver<br><br>was found dead in this room,<br><br>laying in a pool<br>of her own blood.<br><br>It's said that she<br>committed suicide<br><br>after a psychotic breakdown<br><br>following the<br>murder of her baby.<br><br>Uh, after she became pregnant,<br><br>she was admitted to this<br>hospital for anxiety.<br><br>The doctor in charge believed<br>her unborn baby was the devil,<br><br>so immediately<br>upon giving birth,<br><br>he slit the baby's throat<br>as she watched helplessly.<br><br>He didn't even bother to cut<br>the umbilical cord first.<br><br>She completely lost it<br><br>and was locked in this<br>room to rot and die.<br><br>It's said that she just<br>rocked back and forth,<br><br>begging for them to<br>give her her baby back.<br><br>One night she managed<br>to break the window<br><br>and using a shard of glass,<br><br>she disemboweled<br>herself completely.<br><br>[ominous music swelling]<br><br>- Cut.<br><br>Damn, you're good.<br><br>That was, that was good.<br><br>What about the other rooms?<br><br>- Um, yes.<br><br>Uh, well, the infirmary<br>is down the hall.<br><br>- I'm in.<br><br>[ominous music]<br><br>- So is it true that<br>if you listen closely,<br><br>sometimes you can hear a<br>hummed song to a dead kid?<br><br>- [Sarah] Um, well, yeah,<br><br>that's part of the<br>folklore of this place.<br><br>But mainly it's<br>just scary stories<br><br>told to frighten little kids.<br><br>- Well that's a shame.<br><br>Maybe if we're lucky we'll get<br>a chance to hear something.<br><br>[Chad humming]<br><br>Mary, Mary?<br><br>Oh, look at that.<br><br>That's a creepy shot.<br><br>[tense music]<br><br>[Chad humming]<br><br>[ominous music]<br><br>- [Mary] Sarah.<br><br>- Hey!<br>[Sarah screams]<br><br>I think I found it.<br><br>-

Is that it?<br><br>Well, yeah, she's a Christian.<br><br>I also sent her on a tour<br>of the monasteries.<br><br>City hall gave them<br>some holiday tickets, but…<br><br>They ripped them off,<br><br>lugged them around in scorching heat,<br><br>in some junk busses.<br><br>She had some money from me, but…<br><br>Some folks couldn't even buy a sandwich.<br>When they got back, I went to pick her up.<br><br>They looked really bad.<br>Two hags started crying, a guy fainted…<br><br>Like were coming back<br>from one of those bad jails.<br><br>But Mom was happy.<br>She'd seen the monasteries.<br><br>-If you take her to the Vatican in Rome…<br>-Yeah.<br><br>I don't want a poor tour, either.<br><br>I want a good hotel, restaurants.<br><br>It's sad, man.<br><br>-What?<br>-Stuff.<br><br>This wish of yours is so cheap.<br><br>Literally cheap.<br><br>How much would it cost you?<br>1,500 euros? 1,000?<br><br>No! Less.<br><br>Two hundred for the flight,<br>150 if you book early.<br><br>Two hundred for the hotel,<br>I want a good one.<br><br>And, like, how much can you pay<br>for two meals per day at a restaurant?<br><br>Six hundred, 650 tops.<br><br>I can give 1000 euros right now,<br>we just stop at an ATM, it's nothing.<br><br>-How could you?<br>-Hold on. I won't.<br><br>I can't, 'cause I'd ruin<br>the natural order of things.<br><br>You're a small fry<br>who has to work to get to Rome.<br><br>I was just saying. It's cheap.<br>For fuck's sake, it's green.<br><br>Are you eating this?<br><br>No, thank you.<br><br>How's it going?<br><br>Bad.<br><br>-What does ""bad"" mean?<br>-It means bad.<br><br>I don't feel like talking about it.<br><br>I'm sorry about…<br><br>Well… what you told me earlier.<br><br>I thought about it, and…<br><br>You're right.<br><br>It's not that I don't want you anymore.<br>Of course I do.<br><br>Maybe… I don't know,<br>I didn't figure out what it'd be like.<br><br>I figured we'd see each other less.<br><br>But I thought if we're good<br>when we do see each other…<br><br>No, but you're right. It's not okay.<br><br>But we'll pull through.<br><br>-We won't.<br>-Sure, we will.<br><br>We can both chip in for that vibrator<br>and we'll take it from there.<br><br>Liviu.<br><br>I think I want to break up.<br><br>I'll switch back to the day shift<br>and start going to job interviews again.<br><br>-Maybe I gave up too fast. I'll go again.<br>-Liviu.<br><br>Maybe Lica is right, too.<br>About Uber, I mean.<br><br>It's still taxi driving, but you work more<br>during the day, make more money.<br><br>Worth a shot,<br>at least till I find something else.<br><br>Do you hear me?<br><br>I hear you, of course I do. I hear you.<br><br>We're not breaking up.<br><br>Victoria!<br><br>But that's what I want.<br><br>No.<br><br>Liviu, it doesn't work like that.<br>You can't just say no.<br><br>C'mon, Mom,<br>we can't call the ambulance every night.<br><br>Hello, ma'am!<br><br>-How are you feeling?<br>-Better.<br><br>Have some water.<br><br>I've thought about it<br>and I don't want us to break up.<br><br>Liviu, it doesn't work like this.<br><br>That's right!<br><br>That's right, it doesn't work like that.<br><br>After 12 years, you can't just tell me:<br>""That's it, we're breaking up.""<br><br>You can tell me you don't like it anymore,<br>and I get it, and…<br><br>I'll try to change something,<br>I don't know.<br><br>Maybe you want a new house. New furniture.<br><br>We'll have a baby, too.<br><br>I'm telling you I want to break up<br>and you want a baby?<br><br>Okay, no baby. Whatever you want.<br><br>To break up.<br><br>Not that.<br><br>-Let's talk like grownups.<br>-There's nothing to talk about.<br><br>I mean, there is, but not about this,<br>I don't know…<br><br>We'll talk about whatever you want,<br>I don't know…<br><br>What is it you don't like anymore?<br><br>I'll change jobs and we'll spend<br>more time together. As much as you need!<br><br>I was thinking of…<br><br>Moving back here.<br><br>Wouldn't we have been better off<br><br>if we didn't have<br>to come back in the country?<br><br>I can't believe you're saying this.<br><br>No, like… I mean… I didn't mean, like…<br><br>I'm not saying it was your fault.<br>I said it back then, too.<br><br>She's your mom. It happened and that's it.<br><br>We do what we have to.<br>We both agreed on coming back.<br><br>But…<br><br>It was bad luck.<br><br>We won't have bad luck all our lives,<br>right?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>I promised.<br><br>Okay?<br><br>I promised.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>-Wassup, man?<br>-Cheers.<br><br>Listen.<br><br>When can you pay me back?<br><br>Didn't you say that…?<br><br>I know what I said, but…<br><br>If you need it…<br><br>-I need it, yeah.<br>-What happened?<br><br>I need it. Does it matter what for?<br><br>Yo, chill man.<br>I said I'd give it to you, I will.<br><br>I was asking<br>maybe I can help with something.<br><br>You can't.<br><br>Look, I'll give you two million<br>after the weekend,<br><br>Next week, another two or three, and<br>the rest by the end of the month. Okay?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>I wanna take Victoria on holiday.<br><br>She's tired, she's down, I don't know.<br>I wanna surprise her.<br><br>She said she wants to break up with me.<br><br>She's not gonna, man.

What? No, it has nothing to…<br><br>-It has nothing to do with this!<br>-Of course it doesn't.<br><br>Some stuff's been adding up.<br><br>She's tired, too…<br><br>So you're going home<br>to convince her she's tired? Or what?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>Go home, man.

more<br>and more time here.<br><br>It was wonderful<br>in every season, but...<br><br>something<br>about Christmas...<br><br>Christmas was<br>the most special.<br><br>And the two of you<br>wrote that up there?<br><br>That was, uh,<br>the poet in him, I suppose.<br><br>James always believed<br>that truth and grace<br><br>were the two most important<br>qualities in any life.<br><br>Truth in

for her,<br><br>I couldn't<br>forgive him.<br><br>I just couldn't bear<br>to look at those words anymore,<br><br>and so I covered them up.<br><br>But you did forgive him.<br><br>With time,<br>and

I used to hate it, but...<br><br>you know, I loved him! So I got used to it.<br><br>Ok, umm... As frightening<br>as the visual of Dad<br><br>with a cucumber in his underwear is...<br><br>and I am certain I will never be<br>able to fully get that out of my head...<br><br>How is that in the least bit relevant<br>to the fact that the man I'm living with...<br><br>is a mass murderer!!!<br><br>Honey, because true<br>love requires sacrifice.<br><br>I've died and gone to Hell.<br><br>Oh, honey...<br><br>Oh! your hair looks nice today!<br><br>The only solution was to catch Lyle myself.<br><br>How was your day, Lyle?<br><br>Oh, not so special.<br><br>Poured a couple of foundation,<br>committed a couple of homicides.<br><br>Oh, and I closed a sale on that<br>twelve unit condominium complex.<br><br>Run that one by me again!...?<br><br>So how is your friend's acting going?<br><br>Huh?<br><br>Your friend, whose... head,<br><br>I mean head shot!

Okay.<br><br>Hey! This is a legal parking space.<br><br>Ahh... No, no. No. Yeah, I am<br>in the way.

I confess!<br><br>You're a hit man, aren't you?<br><br>See now, I prefer mortality consultant.<br><br>Where did you put the bodies?<br><br>Normally that's very<br>privileged information.<br><br>But, seeing on how we're living together...<br><br>I'll show you.<br><br>Show me?<br>-Yeah, it'll be fun!<br><br>I would rather not.<br>-Oh, come on.<br><br>Actually, my mom called, we<br>are gonna go for coffee together.<br><br>- I am fairly positive, you may enjoy this.<br>- Nah.<br><br>Hello<br><br>Mmmm! mmm!<br><br>See now, this is going to help<br>you better empathize with the<br><br>individuals that we're gonna go see.<br><br>It's going to make the<br>experience that much richer.<br><br>Shhh.. This is tough stuff.<br><br>Struggling against duct tape...<br><br>only makes it tighter. Okay?<br>So you can do what you want, but<br><br>I wouldn't do that if I<br>were you, but it's your call.<br><br>I'm not sure you are going to enjoy<br>this experience like I thought you would.<br><br>Oh well, anyway, it will be fine.<br><br>What, have you been working out, girl?<br><br>And that's how I got myself<br>into the trunk of this car.<br><br>Help!<br><br>Ahhhh!<br><br>Ahhhh!!<br><br>No one can hear you.<br><br>Ahhhh!<br><br>Now you're just startling<br>the wild life, Charlotte.<br><br>Where are we?<br><br>Somewhere in the valley, I think.<br><br>The bodies, they're all here?<br><br>Affirmative.<br><br>Where?<br><br>Where?<br><br>You're standing on Mister Button.<br><br>Ahhh!

Chad and Scott.<br><br>And right there is your old boss.<br><br>And then a few of my professional<br>clients are mixed in with them.<br><br>So, homicide is in fact your profession.<br><br>It's more of a calling, really.<br><br>How could you do that?<br><br>What... You mean did I go to school for it?<br><br>No. I mean, how can you make the<br>taking of human life your profession?<br><br>How does anyone chose a profession, really?<br><br>I mean, what makes a professional wrestler?<br><br>What makes a professional bird watcher?<br><br>What makes a professional vegetable taster?<br><br>Who knows how these<br>things sort themselves out?<br><br>Okay, bird watching isn't a profession.<br><br>Why not?<br><br>It's more of a hobby.<br><br>The Audubon Society is<br>professional bird watchers.<br><br>No, they're volunteers.<br><br>Get down on your knees.<br><br>Excuse me?<br><br>My instructions were not ambiguous.<br><br>Why do you want me to get down on my knees?<br><br>No.<br><br>I'm a Buddhist.<br><br>You're going to kill me.<br><br>Yep.<br><br>But I thought you loved me.<br><br>Hey, I do love you.<br><br>But I'm not going to go to prison for you.<br><br>- My love has boundaries.<br>- But I'm not going to send you to prison.<br><br>Oh, so those cops you<br>were talking to, they're<br><br>helping you with the<br>neighborhood watch program?<br><br>You know about them?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Well, I got scared.<br><br>What do you want, when you find<br>out your boyfriend is a serial killer?<br><br>Maybe a little bit of gratitude.<br><br>You know maybe... ""Thank you, Lyle.""<br><br>Thank you for making<br>all my dreams come true.<br><br>Thank you for wasting all those horrible,<br>evil people who ever did me wrong.<br><br>Well, when you put it that way...<br><br>No!<br>-Down -Please!<br><br>Any final words?<br><br>My mind's a blank.<br><br>You could say, uh...<br><br>""Please forgive me God for all my sins.""<br><br>but I'm not Catholic.<br><br>I'm not going to tell anybody.<br><br>Okay, okay!<br><br>God...<br><br>You know, I tried to be a good person.<br><br>But, ah...<br><br>If I'm being totally honest, which...<br><br>I'm pretty sure is a large<br>component of praying, then ahh...<br><br>I'm kind of glad the<br>cheesy weatherman is dead.<br><br>And, since you're God, all<br>powerful and all that, then<br><br>lying to you is pretty much fruitless.<br><br>So I must admit...<br><br>that I'm happy about the prick,<br>who took my virginity being dead too!<br><br>And let's face it...<br><br>That asshole, Mister<br>Button... did not deserve to live.<br><br>I mean, come on! Mister<br>Mister Weller, good riddance.<br><br>Fruit Loops, bark in the afterlife!<br><br>Ruff! Ruff!<br><br>Wick! See ya! Wouldn't want to be ya!<br><br>And that prick who always<br>took my parking space?<br><br>Happy trails!<br><br>My wish list wasn't hypothetical.<br><br>I genuinely wanted all of them croaked.<br><br>Every single one.<br><br>Which could only mean that...<br><br>Babe, will you get the phone?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Wilkes Contracting.<br><br>Oh hi, Mom!<br><br>Well umm...<br><br>If it's a girl we're thinking, ""Phoebe"".<br><br>If it's a boy, we like ""Shane"".<br><br>Lyle Junior.<br><br>Oh, correction, ""Lyle Junior.""<br><br>I'm good.

Spooky isn't it?<br><br>-Ouch!<br>-This is the request of the client.<br><br>People have different ways of praying.<br><br>-Remember we're recording it!<br>-Excuse me.<br><br>Now it's time.<br><br>2:00 am in the morning.<br><br>It'll soon be at 2:00 in the morning.<br>I start praying from now.<br><br>Boss started praying according<br>to the memo of the client.<br><br>There is one sickle at every corner.<br><br>Cut the rope with the sickle.<br><br>Repeat to do the same.<br><br>*We edit the in-between.<br><br>Stick four sickles on the ground to make a square.<br><br>Pour sake into the cup in front of the grave.<br><br>And drink it all.<br><br>Chant a mantra.<br><br>And pray.<br><br>He finished praying.<br><br>Stray dogs?<br><br>Sorry, boss. The light is out.<br><br>Boss? Yours is also out?<br><br>Boss?<br><br>Boss!<br><br>Boss!<br><br>Video was then taken with infrared camera mode.<br><br>Boss...what are you doing?<br><br>The noise started to appear on the screen.<br><br>Boss, what are you doing?<br><br>Boss?<br><br>Boss!<br><br>Boss!<br><br>Where are you going? Wait please!<br><br>Boss!<br><br>Boss...be careful!<br><br>It was strange that the lights were<br>gone at the same time.<br><br>So I got scared...<br><br>I brought my camera with me.<br><br>Then I remembered it had<br>an infrared camera mode.<br><br>That's what I recorded.<br><br>After that I was not even looking for my boss.<br><br>I came running towards the car somehow...<br><br>with the light from the camera in the darkness.<br><br>On the way back to the car, I got lost and<br>it took quite a while to be back there.<br><br>I was totally in a panic, I even forgot<br>to turn off the camera.<br><br>Boss?<br><br>Boss!<br><br>Boss!<br><br>Boss.<br><br>He tried to take out the cellphone...<br><br>The video holder left the camera and ran away.<br><br>But the camera recorded everything<br><br>until the very end.<br><br>Video holder: Kouta Takagi<br><br>In order to call the ambulance,<br>he tried to catch the signal.<br><br>His boss: Yoshiyasu Hirano (fictitious name)<br><br>His boss Mr. Hirano was carried to the hospital,<br>but he was already dead.<br><br>The police ruled out foul play<br>about his death according to the autopsy.<br><br>The cause of his death was Dyspnea.<br><br>There was no scars or no trace of being murdered.<br><br>After his death, what happened to the company?<br><br>His company doesn't exist anymore.<br><br>And the tape...<br><br>I gave it to his wife.<br><br>But I was worried and I copied<br>the data before I gave it to her.<br><br>And there are some strange points.<br><br>The map and memo which my boss had...<br><br>We couldn't find them.<br><br>The police looked for where the grave was...<br><br>They couldn't find the grave.<br><br>The locals didn't even know about the grave.<br><br>About the client...<br><br>when we checked...<br><br>we found out that all the informations<br>about the client were false.<br><br>We couldn't find out who that was.<br><br>The police ruled out foul play.<br><br>They did not go for further investigations.<br><br>One of the party is suspiciously dead.<br><br>Any relations with inexplicable heads?<br><br>In order to find out about the grave and<br>the way how his boss prayed,<br><br>we requested the opinion of the expert.<br><br>The expert: Assistant professor<br><br>Well, I saw the video.<br><br>And I have never seen this case before.<br><br>It has a stupa, so this surely is a grave.<br><br>I noticed that the grave was surrounded by ropes...<br><br>so, this could have been some sort of a ceremony.<br><br>For instance, there is a ceremony using sickles.<br><br>Partly cult of Suwa.<br><br>It is a pray for the huge harvest.<br><br>*Cult of Suwa<br>The cult that worships Suwa Shrine<br>in Nagano prefecture.<br><br>It can be said that it's a sort of an curse magic.<br><br>So the pray that we see in this case in video...<br><br>I'm not sure what the intention was...<br><br>It could have been a sort of ceremony<br>rather than just visiting grave.<br><br>That was the impression I got.<br><br>We got interesting informations<br>from a person we know.<br><br>Ex production manager of famous horror videos:<br>Hajime Izuki<br><br>I happened to interview the shaman.<br><br>He said that ...<br><br>there is a place where you can curse a person by<br>doing a certain thing at a certain place.<br><br>You might have heard about it as well.<br><br>For example, if you whisper<br>the name of God at a ruined Shrine...<br><br>you will be cursed to death.<br><br>This is true.<br><br>So if you wish a person to be dead,<br>you take him there to curse him to death.<br><br>This is an actual practice.<br><br>But it is hard to do, because<br>normally such a place...<br><br>is far to go and to take him<br>there is a hard thing to do.<br><br>So it's actually difficult.<br><br>And we...<br><br>reach to a conclusion.<br><br>The client's intention was to make him<br>do the things to curse himself.<br><br>The reason why the client asked him<br>to record everything was to make sure<br>that he does the ceremony.<br><br>There is no evidence that he is murdered.<br><br>But the client must have made<br>him curse to death.<br><br>The conclusion we reached may be right.<br><br>There is a suspicious person recorded on the tape.<br><br>This is part of the video when the<br>video holder runs away to call ambulance.<br><br>He put his camera on the<br>bonnet of the car and left.<br><br>The camera caught the passenger's seat<br>through the front glass.<br><br>Fast-forwarding<br><br>Few minutes later<br><br>The image is rough, but surely someone is there.<br><br>Please watch as we make it brighter.<br><br>The map and memo which Mr. Hirano had...<br><br>must have been taken away by this person.<br><br>Could this person who looks inside the car<br>be the client who cursed Mr. Hirano to death?<br><br>Video holder: Kouta Takagi<br><br>We sent him the mail of what we think.<br><br>Then, he gave us a quick response.<br><br>On the day we went to visit grave...<br><br>now I have some thoughts in my mind.<br><br>Some thoughts?<br><br>Just before we go,<br><br>Boss's wife came out to see us off.<br><br>She looked quite happy that time.<br><br>Boss also said in the car that she looked happy.<br><br>What about it?<br><br>Yes. Normally, she helped my boss.<br><br>And well...<br><br>But my boss always yelled at her<br>or hit her in the head. Or even kicked her.<br><br>I worked there for about a year or so<br><br>but she's always sorrowful,<br>I have never seen her smiling.<br><br>So she was not how she was normally.<br><br>No.<br><br>The curse ceremony under<br>the disguise of visiting grave...<br><br>What does his wife have to do with it?<br><br>Do you know how to keep in touch with her?<br><br>I don't know...<br><br>After this, it seems that she moved out.<br><br>Where she is now, I don't know.<br><br>I heard that she bought an apartment<br>close to where her parents live.<br><br>Mrs. Hirano<br><br>was a beneficiary of huge amount of<br>life insurance.<br><br>If Mr. Hirano was cursed to death,the client<br>could have been someone just close to him.<br><br>At present, there are many agencies<br>that undertake curse magic to curse someone.<br><br>Service for curse<br><br>Present law of Japan<br><br>does not punish the murder done by curse magic<br><br>Go game<br><br>The video of playing Go game.<br><br>This video was taken by his father 15 years ago<br>when a video holder went to visit his grand father.<br><br>According to him, it was during the summer holiday.<br><br>Recently, he converted the home videos to DVD.<br><br>Then he found out an inexplicable<br>existence in the video.<br><br>Please watch the part of the video<br>in question.<br><br>The white face appeared from the wall<br>and then disappeared<br><br>Please watch this again.<br><br>All of them who were there at that time<br>are dead except for the video holder.<br><br>His grand father, his father,<br>and his sister are dead now<br><br>Moreover, this house was burnt down<br>by suspicious fire few years later.<br><br>At an apartment few decades ago<br><br>the video was found out during the cleaning<br><br>Video holder: ex-president of a cleaning company<br><br>Many Yakuzas lived in that apartment.<br><br>Close to the dangerous area.<br><br>The apartment with backstreet people.<br><br>By the time they rent the place,<br>they say they are clean office workers.<br><br>I found the video there.<br><br>The first time I watched it, I was shocked.<br><br>We also do some related works...<br><br>so we knew this kind of thing exists.<br><br>Honestly speaking, I felt really bad.<br><br>Revenge<br><br>Are you alright with it?<br><br>Do you agree?<br><br>Do you agree?<br><br>You are not young already.<br><br>No red lights.<br><br>With a baby, no.<br><br>Your parents?<br><br>Any siblings?<br><br>This is no joke.<br><br>This is no joke.<br><br>Are you listening?<br><br>Ok, I'll do.<br><br>Ok, you tell the camera that you'll do.<br><br>I'll do.<br><br>The pregnant woman owe some debts...<br><br>and was forced to do something<br><br>Ok, do it.<br><br>I give you something nice.<br><br>Let her drink it.<br><br>Drink it.<br><br>Drink it, I said.<br><br>Two men let the woman<br><br>have some tablets forcibly.<br><br>Okey.<br><br>Now she wears white Kimono.<br><br>Are you scared?<br><br>I'll do it.<br><br>May I practice?<br><br>Sure, go ahead.<br><br>Cutting at a stroke?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Is it because of the tablet she had?<br><br>She acts different than before.<br><br>Where should I cut?<br><br>Could be anywhere in the middle.<br><br>Stick the knife and slide it to the side.<br><br>Slide it...<br><br>To the side.<br><br>Right.<br><br>Right.<br><br>Ok, do it.<br><br>Should I put it?<br><br>Ok, well...<br><br>When I say go, you do it<br>after you count 10 seconds.<br><br>-You open the front.<br>-Do I open it?<br><br>Right.<br><br>The image you will see next moment might give you<br>a serious impact to your mind and body.<br><br>If you are unwilling to see, please stop playing or<br>please start watching from the next chapter.<br>We do not bear any responsibilities.<br><br>Ok, go.<br><br>I do it.<br><br>Wait, open the front!<br><br>Open the front of your Kimono, I told you!<br><br>What should we do?<br><br>Do it again!<br><br>What are you doing?<br><br>The woman attacked men.<br><br>Cut.<br><br>Cut.<br><br>Cut what?<br><br>Cut her stomach.<br><br>Cut her stomach!<br><br>Take out a baby.<br><br>Take out a baby<br><br>What will we do?<br><br>What will we do?<br><br>We take her to the bathroom.

I guess I'm mistaken, then.<br><br>That's how I know you.<br><br>I've seen you on TV.<br><br>- No.<br>- Yes, y-you're that psychic.<br><br>- No. Yes, I am, but don't worry.<br>- I've gotta go.<br><br>No, listen, I'm getting out of that.<br><br>I, uh... I'm going to, uh,<br>focus only on being a pharmacist.<br><br>I'm telling you. Don't go.<br><br>Excuse me. I just spoke to Gloria.<br>She's not feeling well.<br><br>Right, then. Let's go. I better get home.<br><br>I get off in half an hour, and...<br><br>So, maybe we could get a drink<br>or something.<br><br>Me? Oh, no, no. I can't.<br><br>Sure.<br><br>That's fine. Uh...

I...<br>- Oh, hello.<br><br>...came to, uh...<br><br>Oh, yes. Uh, they left a little while ago.<br><br>I'll just come back<br>another day. Thank you.<br><br>They close earlier every day now,<br>since there are no customers.<br><br>And this morning,<br>a man went running out of here,<br><br>as if the police were after him.<br><br>- Mm-hmm.<br>- Poor man looked like he wet his pants.<br><br>Have you lived<br>in the caretaker's quarters long?<br><br>I was very young<br>when I came here with my husband.<br><br>You know what happened here, right?<br><br>- Are you referring to the murder?<br>- Yes.<br><br>Tragically, my husband was killed.<br>Poor sweet man.<br><br>And I was left alone<br>with the girl.<br><br>- You have my sympathies.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>I could actually let you in if you'd like.<br>I have the keys.<br><br>- As long as that's all right.<br>- I'm sure it's fine.<br><br>You're a priest, after all.<br><br>And I see you on TV a lot.<br><br>There you go, Father.<br><br>When you're done, could you please<br>leave the keys in the caretaker's slot?<br><br>- No problem. Thank you.<br>- God be with you.<br><br>Argh!<br><br>From the mid-1980s,<br><br>Pilón had created<br>an interdisciplinary research group<br><br>to study all forms<br>of paranormal phenomena.<br><br>FATHER PILÓN IN SERIOUS CONDITION<br><br>It's a rare medium,<br>because it's a concept,<br><br>uh, that combines the other two.<br><br>Clairvoyance being one<br>and the experience in time and telepathy.<br><br>Four minutes for me.<br>It's my time limit for any incorporation.<br><br>If you exceed that limit,<br><br>you run the very serious risk<br>of not coming back.<br><br>Precisely, because when she goes<br>into a trance,<br><br>the spirit of the deceased<br>encompasses Gloria.<br><br>But fortunately,<br>they're always peaceful. Huh?<br><br>And usually quite polite.<br><br>One of the most<br>popular cases was Vergara Palace,<br><br>which even made front-page news<br>at the time.<br><br>The psychophony found there<br>was well known throughout the country.<br><br>Tell them about, uh, Vergara.<br><br>That's a good example.<br><br>Sorry. Could we...<br>Could we just cut it for a minute?<br><br>I want you all at home<br>to have a good listen to this.<br><br>It's a sound segment.<br><br>Only three precisely.<br><br>Only three precisely.<br><br>Only three precisely.<br><br>It isn't a normal reaction.<br><br>And we verified that with every piece<br>of equipment we have,<br><br>as well as our medium, Gloria.<br><br>Is it true that she was unconscious<br>for several minutes?<br><br>Let's just say<br>that this case is complicated.<br><br>And we just want to wish<br>a very speedy recovery to Father Pilón,<br><br>who, by the way, hasn't come<br>to see us in quite a while now.<br><br>And now for the weather.<br><br>Looks like we are expecting<br>some pretty heavy storm activity<br><br>all across the Peninsula...<br><br>Listen to them.<br>Already got him dead and buried.<br><br>They just had<br>to bring up Vergara Palace.<br><br>Hi.<br><br>That's all for now.<br>Back to you, Minerva.<br><br>Thank you, Angela.<br><br>How's he doing?<br><br>It must have been<br>something pretty incredible<br><br>to leave him in this condition.<br><br>Oh, please.<br><br>He drank ten coffees a day,<br>never slept more than three hours.<br><br>I know.<br>It's just, he looked fine yesterday.<br><br>Just goes to show,<br>you never know till it hits you.<br><br>Why'd you let him go alone?<br><br>Ugh! Well, at least<br>I showed up for the meeting.<br><br>Oh, so I guess<br>I'm not allowed to be sick now.<br><br>Sick?<br><br>- That's right, I was.<br>- Sick. Yeah, right. Right.<br><br>I'm sure you were sick, real sick.<br><br>Now I see why he skipped the protocol.<br>All research has to be done in a team.<br><br>He said he had a hunch,<br>and he was worried about it.<br><br>He was in a rush. You know how he is.<br><br>But he never said he was going alone...<br><br>...at any time.<br><br>- Ever.<br>- What are you making?<br><br>A blanket, to keep him warm.<br><br>What is this?<br><br>- Only one visitor's allowed in here.<br>- Oh, really?<br><br>Well, it seems like<br>there's many more than that in here.<br><br>And a lady who says<br>she's going to sue you for negligence.<br><br>None of these ladies<br>are my patients, ma'am.<br><br>She says she came here<br>with a tumor the size of a potato<br><br>and that you prescribed a laxative.<br><br>Poor lady.<br><br>- She died two days later.<br>- Oh.<br><br>Okay, everyone out, right now.<br><br>- Out, all of you!<br>- Calm down.<br><br>- Can I just finish the blanket?<br>- Take your things and leave!<br><br>You have to be strong now.<br><br>But why?<br><br>The ball, I forgot it.<br><br>Gloria.<br><br>What?<br><br>We need to find out what happened.<br><br>TOBACCO SHOP<br><br>- Where's Gerardo?<br>- He wanted to stay with Father.<br><br>Hi. How are you?<br><br>Shut the window. We're gonna get soaked.<br><br>What happened is not normal.<br><br>Let's stay focused, all right?<br><br>He's old,<br>and the man smokes like a chimney.<br><br>Let's just follow the protocol<br>and see what we find.<br><br>What protocol?<br><br>When you're investigating<br>paranormal phenomena,<br><br>the first thing you do<br>is rule out any normal phenomena.<br><br>Exactly. You verify that all conditions<br>fall under what's considered normal.<br><br>The phenomena can't follow<br>the regular laws of physics.<br><br>Understand?<br><br>And that's where you<br>and all your gadgets come in.<br><br>Generally, when something<br>inexplicable occurs,<br><br>it's because an entity is trapped<br>within the interface.<br><br>All right. Hang on a minute.<br><br>Uh, the neuroanatomical substrata<br>that enables consciousness...<br><br>...is the brain.<br><br>A-And when it stops working,<br>consciousness ceases, inevitably.<br><br>This kid cracks me up.<br><br>- This is Gerardo's report. Have a look.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- Open it.<br>- All right.<br><br>In the 16th century,<br>there was a rectory on this land.<br><br>And in 1538, it burned to the ground.<br><br>There was absolutely nothing left.<br>Then an Italian trader bought the land...<br><br>Right then, he built a house<br>that stayed in his family for centuries,<br><br>and in '89,<br>the tenant who lived in the basement<br><br>bludgeoned a neighbor to death.<br><br>Mother of God.<br><br>If he stayed in the interface,<br>he must have been seriously pissed off.<br><br>""In the interface.""<br><br>- Oh, yeah.<br>- Don't worry. Relax.<br><br>Most of the time,<br>all of these phenomena are poltergeists,<br><br>caused by people who live in the house.<br><br>The dead are not violent.<br><br>The violent ones are the living.<br><br>They may throw stuff around,<br>but they never hurt us.<br><br>Most of the time,<br>they just do it for attention.<br><br>Paz!<br><br>Just remember,<br>no matter what happens, stay calm.<br><br>If you're really lucky<br>and Gloria happens to contact one of them,<br><br>it'll open your mind immediately,<br><br>because I'm telling you,<br>watching her is a real show.<br><br>- That's a compliment?<br>- You're better when you're in a trance.<br><br>Hmm. All right, stop. It's here.<br><br>Ouch!<br><br>Dammit.<br><br>It's raining cats and dogs.<br><br>Jesus!<br><br>Is this good?<br><br>Perfect!<br><br>THEATER<br><br>- Do you not smoke?<br>- No.<br><br>- These young people are so boring.<br>- Mm.<br><br>All right. Let's go.<br><br>Enrique?<br><br>Nice to meet you.<br><br>Enrique. My wife Marisa.<br><br>- Hello. Nice to meet you.<br>- Hello.<br><br>- I'm Sagrario.<br>- Ruiz de Carvajal. I know who you are.<br><br>Great.<br><br>Oh, Palomeque! Wow!<br><br>Being a psychic<br>must be absolutely incredible.<br><br>If you don't mind,<br>I prefer the term ""medium.""<br><br>- Of course. ""Medium."" That's nice.<br>- And this is Paz.<br><br>- Ah, I don't think I know you.<br>- You don't.<br><br>I'm the one who documents<br>and records everything.<br><br>- I see.<br>- And this is Pablo, our physicist.<br><br>- Hello.<br>- So nice to meet you.<br><br>Good to meet you.<br><br>You're so young-looking to be a physicist.<br><br>- Aren't you?<br>- Well, I'm still studying.<br><br>- Oh, Sagrario, excuse me. Forgive me, but...<br>- Yes?<br><br>Uh, how is Priest doing?<br><br>Well... badly, sadly.<br><br>- Uh, he's still in the hospital.<br>- Poor man.<br><br>- What a fright that must have been.<br>- Yes.<br><br>Actually, when I saw him,<br>I was so thrilled.<br><br>You were thrilled?<br><br>Yes, I'm such a big fan.<br><br>Yeah, I know.<br>It's called ""alopecia areata.""<br><br>Yes, both his eyebrows<br>just fell out suddenly.<br><br>It's stress.<br><br>I draw them on.<br>He thinks it looks ridiculous.<br><br>- Ah.<br>- Why don't we go inside?<br><br>- We can give you all the details.<br>- All right.<br><br>Come in. We're getting wet.<br><br>There you go.<br><br>- You have everything?<br>- Need a hand?<br><br>Hello.<br><br>And what's your name, sweetheart?<br><br>You look so serious, and you're so pretty.<br><br>- I love these pretty pom-poms...<br>- Susanita, go on now.<br><br>- I don't want you bothering anyone.<br>- Oh, she's no bother.<br><br>Hello.<br><br>Can I get you a coffee or something? Huh?<br><br>- I could make you something to eat?<br>- No, we're fine, really.<br><br>No?<br><br>- Thank you so much.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>The caretaker, she's very kind.<br>This way, please.<br><br>Thank you, Chimichurri.<br><br>We started to hear strange noises<br>as soon as we moved in here.<br><br>It's not unusual,<br><br>considering it's an antique store<br>full of old furniture.<br><br>Yes, that's exactly what I said at first.<br><br>Ah. Look here.<br><br>See that candelabra?<br><br>One day, it lit up by itself. Pow.<br><br>Yes, well, sometimes,<br>when water is combined with air,<br><br>the contact is enough to...<br>create spontaneous combustion.<br><br>Wouldn't be the first time<br>this kinda thing's happened.<br><br>During paranormal activity,<br>the temperature drops quite a bit.<br><br>You feel that?<br><br>Sure.<br><br>And whenever the heating is turned off,<br>it gets cold, right?<br><br>Trying to heat this place costs a fortune.<br><br>Um, just so you're aware,<br>we don't charge anything.<br><br>Spirits come from a dimension<br>where the energy vibration<br><br>is much higher than ours.<br><br>And when they come down here,<br>they use a lot of energy.<br><br>Thermal energy.<br>That's why the temperature drops.<br><br>- Frigid.<br>- The cold absorbs the heat.<br><br>- Right.<br>- I've never believed in ghosts...<br><br>...but what happens here is not-not normal.<br><br>We'll see. You...<br><br>- Everything can be explained. Yeah?<br>- Sure. Of course.<br><br>I thought the same way you do,<br>but, uh...<br><br>Uh, would you excuse me a minute?<br><br>It fell onto this here.<br><br>It was already sold and ready for packing.<br><br>- And the mirror remained intact.<br>- Fascinating, no?<br><br>Owners often do this kind of thing<br>to get rid of unwanted tenants.<br><br>- But this is our store.<br>- Really?<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- Yes.<br><br>It doesn't say that here.<br><br>- We signed for it two months ago.<br>- And went pretty deep into debt.<br><br>Don't you worry.<br><br>We'll get to the bottom<br>of what's going on here.<br><br>I haven't noticed anything.<br><br>Apart from...<br><br>...a terrible odor.<br><br>- He has hyperhidrosis.<br>- Hyper what?<br><br>Hyperhidrosis.<br><br>Excessive and abnormal, uh, sweating.<br><br>- It's a challenge to live with.<br>- Hmm.<br><br>- Why don't we do the measurements, Pablo?<br>- Sure.<br><br>- We measure the magnetic field.<br>- I'm familiar how it works.<br><br>Right, Chimichurri?<br>I'm a big fan of Jiménez del Oso.<br><br>I listen to your show every week.<br><br>- I never miss it.<br>- Mine?<br><br>- Yes.<br>- Fabulous. Now you're up to two listeners.<br><br>- You and her.<br>- Funny.<br><br>Now, I'm gonna ask you<br>for a moment of silence, please.<br><br>- Uh, there. It's all set.<br>- Gloria.<br><br>All right now.<br><br>This house...<br><br>...is spick and span.<br><br>Maybe another time.<br><br>Gloria. Gloria.<br><br>- Gloria! What is going on with you?<br>- The place is clean.<br><br>- I have a dinner to get to.<br>- A dinner.<br><br>- And that's why it's clean?<br>- What? No.<br><br>Come on. Father had a feeling,<br>and look what happened.<br><br>All right, listen.<br>Father had a stroke. Full stop.<br><br>Not everything in life<br>has a supernatural explanation.<br><br>You know that. Why are you so upset?<br>I don't understand you.<br><br>Bullshit. Did you not hear<br>what's happening in there?<br><br>Seriously.<br><br>Didn't you see<br>how out-of-his-mind nervous the owner was?<br><br>- And what does that tell you?<br>- Isn't it obvious?<br><br>He's creating everything<br>in his crazy mind.<br><br>Look at this!<br><br>This doll appeared in thin air,<br>out of nowhere.<br><br>We found it over there, this way.<br><br>In that room over there, like this.<br><br>Without a body.<br><br>No, no, no. I'm outta here.<br><br>Hey. Father would never refuse to help.<br><br>Anyone who asked for help,<br>he'd be there for them.<br><br>Do what you want.<br><br>God. She can be so manipulative.<br><br>Mind if I take a few samples?<br><br>- Of course. Whatever you need.<br>- Great. Thank you.<br><br>- We'd never seen it before.<br>- Right.<br><br>With all the little trinkets<br>you have here...<br><br>Gloria will use her ball to tell us<br>if anything abnormal is going on.<br><br>- A ball?<br>- Oh, that's great.<br><br>- Yes, of course I will.<br>- Good.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>Gloria will now use the ball to create<br>a border between their world and ours.<br><br>- Wah.<br>- Ready, Gloria?<br><br>I must have dropped it in the van<br>with Paz's crazy driving.<br><br>Walk back and get it.<br>It's probably lying on the floor.<br><br>- I'll get the keys.<br>- Lots of things vanish here.<br><br>That's true. The accounting book,<br>keys, the embalmed glass eye.<br><br>I'll be right back.<br><br>- All kinds of objects.<br>- Indeed.<br><br>I'd bet my earrings<br>that the ball is in her handbag.<br><br>I got it.<br><br>I got it.<br><br>- It was in my handbag.<br>- Right.<br><br>Let's continue. Quiet now.<br><br>Paz.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>- Uh...<br>- Was that you?<br><br>Huh? No.<br><br>- Um...<br>- First things first.<br><br>If anybody here makes a noise,<br>raise your hand and say, ""It was me.""<br><br>Gloria, I really hope<br>this is not one of your jokes right now.<br><br>No. I have a date.<br><br>Do you remember what that is?<br>It's something a person...<br><br>Fuck.<br><br>- It's coming from there. Yeah.<br>- Okay.<br><br>Record this, Paz.<br><br>- Chimichurri?<br>- Yes, from in here.<br><br>Gloria.<br><br>It's damp here.<br><br>Oof!<br><br>This is worse than Chimichurri's issue.<br><br>- Actually, i-i-it's...<br>- Paz.<br><br>It's normal in...<br>in older buildings like this<br><br>to have leaky pipes.<br><br>This... This...<br><br>This wasn't like this before.<br><br>What do you mean?<br><br>- Maybe you just didn't notice.<br>- No, no.<br><br>Enrique took pictures before,<br><br>to make sure everything<br>was the same the next day.<br><br>Paz.<br><br>I don't believe it.<br><br>What's the matter?<br><br>NOVEMBER 21, 1998<br><br>Okay.<br><br>And there is no way six people...<br><br>- No, no.<br>- ...could move this.<br><br>Then, what could it be?<br>A PSI field? Elohim?<br><br>Geoecia, heloclasty, pandemonium?<br>Or just a common kamarupa?<br><br>- Marisa.<br>- What?<br><br>Calm down.<br><br>There.<br><br>Right there is where I found Father<br>on the ground, sprawled out.<br><br>Right there?<br><br>That's no coincidence.<br><br>Paz.<br><br>- Just a minute, please. Just a minute.<br>- Oh, boy.<br><br>- Wow. That's amazing.<br>- L-Let me through, please.<br><br>Could you please make it stop?!<br><br>- I just sold it.<br>- That's so amazing.<br><br>- That was me.<br>- Pablo.<br><br>Yes, just a sec.<br><br>It's impossible.<br><br>What?<br><br>What?<br><br>- What is it?<br>- Look.<br><br>This can't be.<br><br>- It has to be wrong.<br>- Looks like 18.<br><br>A normal magnetic field in Madrid is 35.<br><br>Do you suffer from migraines?<br><br>Uh, yes. Now that you mention it,<br>I have a terrible migraine.<br><br>Calm down. It has to be<br>because of an iron beam somewhere.<br><br>- In the ceiling, maybe.<br>- Or... Or...<br><br>Maybe this is a door here.<br>They come in that way.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Oh, my God.<br><br>This has got to be a poltergeist<br>caused by somebody.<br><br>- You think?<br>- For the love of God.<br><br>- The mind cannot move physical objects.<br>- Oh, no? It's called ""psychorragia.""<br><br>It's a stream of mental energy<br><br>that acts on material<br>in situations of extreme stress.<br><br>And there is a lot<br>of stress happening here.<br><br>Oh, no, no, no. Don't blame me.<br>Let me just tell you one thing. I, uh...<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Oh, my God.<br><br>- This is not of this world.<br>- Don't underestimate eyebrow man.<br><br>Enrique? Impossible.<br><br>He can't move things with his mind.<br>He can barely even count change.<br><br>When she says ""a door""...<br><br>...does she mean one end<br>of a Rosen-Einstein tunnel<br><br>or a space-time channel?<br><br>Paz!<br><br>Hey, I'm not that ugly.<br><br>My camera!<br><br>Well, now I've seen it all.<br><br>- Good shot.<br>- Did you get it?<br><br>Got it,<br>but my camera might be broken.<br><br>- Pablo, get Paz a chair.<br>- God. That was quite the smack.<br><br>Here, Paz.<br><br>Let's see.<br><br>Unbelievable.<br><br>Calm down.<br><br>Are you all right? Marisa?<br><br>- You're all right?<br>- Yes, it didn't touch me.<br><br>Thank God.<br>It could've seriously cut your arm.<br><br>- It's okay. I'm fine.<br>- Did you look at how fast it was?<br><br>It's not like they were aiming.<br><br>There are more than one?<br><br>Calm down, please.<br>Panicking is not going to help us now.<br><br>Fear is nothing more than a nuisance<br>and a waste of time.<br><br>And specters are like dogs.<br>They can smell it a mile away.<br><br>- Don't say that, Paz.<br>- Just relax.<br><br>- Yeah. Sure. I'm completely relaxed.<br>- Tell me you've got something.<br><br>Here. There it is.<br><br>It looks like<br>it's been sharpened recently.<br><br>But didn't you say you never got hit?<br><br>I'm telling you,<br>it barely even touched me.<br><br>Oh, great. It barely even touched her.<br><br>- It was only a warning.<br>- Fine. Message received, loud and clear.<br><br>Oh, come on! You can't go now.<br>It's just starting to get interesting.<br><br>- It will be worth it...<br>- Listen, I don't feel well!<br><br>Please, Marisa, take him out.<br><br>Take him out for five minutes,<br>just to get some air.<br><br>Hey, I'm not that ugly.<br><br>Look, look.<br><br>- They were aiming.<br>- Huh.<br><br>Yeah, the-the...<br>The energies, they were aiming.<br><br>That was a powerful transmitter<br>of energies.<br><br>- You learn fast.<br>- Uh, excuse me, guys.<br><br>You didn't happen to see my ball, did you?<br><br>- Unbelievable.<br>- Um...<br><br>It was in the other room,<br>last time I saw it.<br><br>Let's see.<br><br>It's a rectilinear movement,<br><br>uniformly accelerated<br>and modified by gravity.<br><br>You have to calculate that.<br>Uh, can you pull back a bit?<br><br>- Sure, wait, I'll do it.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- What's that?<br>- Yours.<br><br>- Batteries run out?<br>- Grab the spares.<br><br>- Are there spares?<br>- Great, kid.<br><br>Now we're gonna have to try<br>to connect to this ancient grid.<br><br>We don't need any gadgets<br>to know something's going on in here.<br><br>Something very big.<br><br>Oh, fantastic.<br>My first Ouija board. Amazing.<br><br>- Can you take a picture of me?<br>- Marisa.<br><br>Come on, don't be a downer.<br>Take my picture.<br><br>- Okay, now sit down.<br>- No, no. It's okay. I'm fine.<br><br>All right, now Ouija is not a game.<br>Do you understand?<br><br>It can be dangerous for people who are...<br><br>emotionally weaker.<br><br>- Talking about me?<br>- Mm-mm. Not at all.<br><br>Now, sit down.<br>Some male energy will be quite useful.<br><br>No, I think I'll stand.<br><br>Right over here, keeping a lookout.<br><br>Yo.<br><br>Male energy, huh?<br>I got tons of that.<br><br>Pablo, if you cheat, I'll be able to tell.<br><br>I'd hope so.<br><br>See that?<br><br>That's real cute. It's a pretty blouse.<br><br>What?<br><br>No.<br><br>- Is this safe?<br>- It is if you know what you're doing.<br><br>Gloria is a phenomenon.<br><br>- Two compliments in one day?<br>- Don't get used to it.<br><br>Come on. I'm meeting someone. Take hands.<br><br>- Marisa, take it easy.<br>- Okay.<br><br>Hands.<br><br>The other one.<br><br>Be ready.<br><br>Are you here?<br><br>Oh, come on. Please.<br><br>A little while ago,<br>you weren't shy at all.<br><br>- Maybe you should lower your tone. Hmm?<br>- Who are you? We're here to help you.<br><br>Well, this is unreal.<br><br>Enrique.<br><br>Would you please stop fidgeting?<br><br>Uh, sorry. Sorry.<br><br>I'm Gloria. Please. You can trust me.<br><br>There it is.<br><br>I'm glad you're with us.<br><br>Now, who are you?<br><br>""Q...""<br><br>""U...""<br><br>""I...""<br><br>""M...""<br><br>- ""I.""<br>- Quimi.<br><br>Quimi, do you live here now?<br><br>""Yes."" Marisa, take your finger off.<br><br>- Why?<br>- Just do it.<br><br>Paz.<br><br>YES - OUIJA - NO<br>FAREWELL<br><br>Gloria, I swear, I'm not doing anything.<br><br>Now.<br><br>Enrique.<br><br>You cannot leave the room now.<br><br>Quimi, does our presence here bother you?<br><br>You're bothered by...<br><br>Enrique and Marisa?<br><br>Quimi, do you want Enrique<br>and Marisa to leave here?<br><br>Well, you don't have to suggest that,<br>do you?<br><br>Dammit. I'm gonna miss my dinner.<br><br>Relax.<br><br>- I-I think the rain blew out the...<br>- Shh!<br><br>Do you see him?<br><br>This is not Quimi. He's a bigger bastard.<br><br>Pablo, the flashlight.<br><br>- Uh, flashlight.<br>- Come on!<br><br>Where do you want us to go?<br><br>- Sorry, it was me. I...<br>- Flashlight.<br><br>Calm down.<br><br>- All right?<br>- Chimichurri?<br><br>Enrique?<br><br>Chimichurri?<br><br>Chimichurri?!<br><br>Chimichurri,<br>sweetie, you scared me.<br><br>Get back.<br><br>Are you Enrique?<br><br>Oh, my God.<br><br>Hey. Enrique.<br><br>Oh. What's going on?<br><br>We have to hold him down!<br><br>Come on! Hurry!<br><br>Careful!<br><br>I-I'm trying...<br><br>I can't... I can't hold him!<br><br>Get him on the ground!<br><br>Okay. I'm holding him.<br><br>We're too damn old for this!<br><br>Speak for yourself!<br><br>- I'm three months younger than you.<br>- Yeah, okay.<br><br>Did you hear that, Paz?<br><br>Loud and clear.<br><br>Look out!<br><br>Sweet baby Jesus!<br><br>Enriquito. Enriquito.<br><br>What have they done to you?<br><br>You all right? Hey. You all right?<br><br>- I think so. Are you?<br>- I'm fine. I'm not hurt.<br><br>- E-Everything okay?<br>- Yes.<br><br>You're welcome.<br><br>You shall be judged.<br><br>I will not. I will not.<br><br>I will not.<br><br>Enrique!<br><br>Enrique!<br><br>Are you okay?<br><br>- I'm cold.<br>- I'll warm you.<br><br>Oh, Chimichurri, please!<br><br>- Easy now. Easy now.<br>- Jesus. He's in rough shape.<br><br>- You okay?<br>- Yeah, I'm good. You all right, Gloria?<br><br>- Yes.<br>- You sure?<br><br>That was unreal.<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- We'll call you tomorrow.<br><br>Take care, now.<br><br>That was crazy.<br><br>I'm like...<br><br>You know, that was the first time<br>I've seen Gloria leave someone alone<br><br>on the Ouija board.<br><br>- Yeah?<br>- Sure.<br><br>That's because I've never met<br>anyone quite like him.<br><br>All right, Pablo...<br><br>When you were a boy,<br>did you wanna sleep with the light on?<br><br>Like most kids, I guess, no?<br><br>And when you're asleep,<br><br>do you feel like someone's watching you?<br><br>You have to learn how to protect yourself.<br><br>- Protect myself from who?<br>- From yourself, Pablo.<br><br>Because this talent you have<br>is a real gift.<br><br>But you can't let this power master you.<br><br>You can't let it.<br><br>You were a really big help tonight.<br><br>- Thank you.<br>- What? No, no, no.<br><br>I-I can't leave now, Gloria.<br>I have to find out how this all ends.<br><br>It's going to be<br>way too dangerous for you.<br><br>Then help me. I know you can.<br><br>- I need your help now...<br>- Listen to me now.<br><br>You're going to have a lot to...<br>to unlearn. Understand?<br><br>- Yes!<br>- Right.<br><br>- And that takes a lot of time.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>And that's time we really don't have.<br><br>Yeah, Gloria, I can unlearn it, I swear.<br>As long as you help me, I can do it.<br><br>You can't rush this.<br><br>I have to tell you, this has been<br>the most amazing night of my life.<br><br>- Oh, really?<br>- Come on, no kidding.<br><br>All right.<br><br>Seriously...<br><br>you guys rock.<br><br>- Yeah, I think we do.<br>- Yep.<br><br>Yep.<br><br>Be careful, okay?<br><br>Everything hurts.<br><br>What's up with you anyway?<br><br>I put cameras in every room,<br>including the hallway.<br><br>- So hopefully, we'll catch something.<br>- Hmm.<br><br>- Mind if I ask what you're doing?<br>- Please, Paz.<br><br>It's only a little tiny knife, all right?<br><br>Sure. You're a real rebel, you know that?<br><br>- How's Sagrario?<br>- She's not doing great.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Take a guess.<br><br>Aw, I wouldn't worry about it.<br><br>She'll get over it.<br><br>You have any idea what might be going on?<br><br>No. I don't have a bloody clue.<br><br>She doesn't have a bloody clue.<br>You got that on tape?<br><br>I gotta admit... I'm completely lost here.<br><br>What if this ""Quimi"" is the one<br>who bludgeoned the neighbor to death?<br><br>Impossible. He said he's here now, 1998.<br><br>- That murder happened ten years ago.<br>- Oh.<br><br>All right, listen.<br>Something just doesn't fit.<br><br>- Here.<br>- Sorry. I'm still in shock.<br><br>Thank you. The music.<br><br>This has nothing to do<br>with your dead husband.<br><br>God, I hate it when you read my mind.<br><br>Well, that's what happens<br>when you're friends with a witch.<br><br>Good friends.<br><br>- You're finished now, right?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- Good. Let's go get a stiff drink.<br>- Great.<br><br>Anyone seen my ball?<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>You look like a fish out of water.<br><br>Well, sorry, but I guess<br>this just isn't my scene.<br><br>No. We know going out isn't your thing.<br><br>And then, there's you.<br>You let your daughter go out for you.<br><br>You really should be on salary<br>for all the hours you spend babysitting.<br><br>Well, if you had kids, you'd understand.<br><br>- I don't, and I understand.<br>- Oh, I forgot, you're a saint.<br><br>- Not a witch like me.<br>- You said it. Whoop.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>- So, what is your scene then? A convent?<br>- Wow.<br><br>All right, that's enough. To each his own.<br>You two just love arguing, huh?<br><br>Salud!<br><br>- No, no. We have to toast to something.<br>- To Father, then.<br><br>- To Father.<br>- All right, to Father.<br><br>- Eh. No, no. You don't toast with water.<br>- What's the big deal?<br><br>It's like my father always told me,<br>never trust anyone who only drinks water.<br><br>Hey, you know something?<br>I understand you a lot better now.<br><br>- Give.<br>- No. Oh, no, no.<br><br>For God's sake.<br>One drink a year isn't gonna kill you.<br><br>- One drink a month is all right as well.<br>- All right, fine.<br><br>- A toast.<br>- You always talk me into things.<br><br>To Father.<br><br>- Sagrario?<br>- Yes?<br><br>Do we know each other?<br><br>Oh, you're all here.<br>This is so exciting.<br><br>You actually saved my life 20 years ago.<br><br>I was a flight attendant,<br>living in a duplex.<br><br>Oh, Mr. Federico!<br><br>- Federico, I remember now.<br>- That's right!<br><br>It's coming back to me.<br>He didn't wanna go.<br><br>He wanted to disinherit his daughter<br>after she sold the apartment.<br><br>- Yes, right.<br>- Right. And you couldn't stop laughing.<br><br>- ""How can he disinherit her if he's dead?""<br>- And he refused to leave.<br><br>""No way. I'm not leaving<br>until I disinherit that girl.""<br><br>I have no idea what you did,<br>but it worked wonders.<br><br>I live there with my son now.<br><br>But he was just a baby.<br><br>Well, that baby is 32 now,<br>with two kids of his own.<br><br>Jesus. Time flies.<br><br>- Sure does.<br>- It's so great to see you again.<br><br>Same here.<br><br>Enjoy your evening.<br><br>- Yes, you too.<br>- Thanks. All the best.<br><br>That Federico was too much<br>with that long coat and gold watch.<br><br>Quite the look.<br><br>We've sure gotten some winners,<br>haven't we?<br><br>That Federico was right before<br>the Vergara Palace, right?<br><br>Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Your Achilles heel.<br><br>Let's just let sleeping dogs lie,<br>all right?<br><br>- Mm.<br>- She came close to biting it that day.<br><br>Um. Sarmiento! That was the SOB's name.<br><br>That bastard sure had a mean streak<br>for a priest.<br><br>Yeah, I remember.<br>He just about killed Gloria.<br><br>Hmm. Yeah, well,<br>at least he left in the end.<br><br>Well, that's what they told us.<br>No thanks to you.<br><br>Would you shut up?<br><br>C'est fini.<br><br>Good evening, my friends.<br><br>Since I'm newly divorced,<br>I'll dedicate this song to all of you.<br><br>The one damn case I screw up.<br><br>One?<br><br>You couldn't contact my husband either.<br><br>No. Please, I'm begging you.<br>Not today, all right?<br><br>I'm exhausted.<br><br>You couldn't, or maybe you wouldn't?<br><br>I don't believe you. This is so unfair.<br><br>We tried for years, me and you.<br><br>You even took me to the car<br>and showed me where...<br><br>the two of you first met.<br><br>- That's true.<br>- Hmm.<br><br>But now I know why you don't want to.<br><br>Oh, so you're a psychic now?<br><br>When I came to the group,<br><br>my one sole purpose was so<br>that I could contact my husband Carlos.<br><br>Are you actually suggesting<br><br>that I haven't contacted him<br>because I want you to stay in the group?<br><br>Who was the one<br>who got Jiménez del Oso to talk to us<br><br>and published all our cases in the press?<br><br>Yeah, you're right. You're right.<br><br>But don't forget, you're the only one<br>who makes any money from what we do.<br><br>This group would cease to exist<br>if it wasn't for me.<br><br>- What about me?<br>- Guess I don't exist.<br><br>No, you record everything,<br>and that's very important.<br><br>But a paranormal research group<br>without a psychic<br><br>might as well be a book-of-the-month club.<br><br>I work my ass off, I'll have you know.<br><br>You only think of the dead<br>till all hours of the morning.<br><br>And you only think about the living<br><br>and giving them<br>prescription medication, right?<br><br>Go ahead. Ask her.<br><br>- No.<br>- She's leaving to be a pharmacist.<br><br>Mm-hmm.<br><br>You went through my papers?<br><br>Unfortunately, I don't read minds yet.<br><br>Go ahead. Ask her.<br><br>Listen.<br><br>They say that whatever you haven't done<br>before you turn 50,<br><br>you're never going to end up doing.<br><br>Well, I've turned 50, all right?<br><br>And then some.<br><br>That's fine. Leave us.<br>Go do whatever you want.<br><br>Great.<br><br>Hey, Gloria,<br>sit down and finish your drink.<br><br>We have to figure out what's going on.<br><br>Thanks, Sagrario, but I don't need<br>your permission to do anything.<br><br>Be careful not to end up like Father.<br><br>Please... let me through.<br><br>She left without paying.<br><br>Oh... God.<br>It's really coming down out there.<br><br>Yeah, you need a good umbrella<br>for this rain.<br><br>Ah, dammit.<br><br>Can you grab this stuff?<br>I'll be right back.<br><br>Sure.<br><br>Key.<br><br>The hell is this?<br><br>Great.<br><br>Coming.<br><br>Coming.<br><br>Hello.<br>I'm sorry to come by so late.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Don't worry. We'll clean it up later.<br><br>Yes, you should clean up inside too.<br><br>Yes, we'll do that.<br><br>My... My show is just about over,<br>so I'm going to go.<br><br>Would I be able to have a word<br>with your daughter?<br><br>- No, no.<br>- I think this is yours, right?<br><br>Yes. Now, please,<br>just leave my daughter alone.<br><br>Yes, but it's...<br><br>It's about the case.<br><br>We need her testimony.<br><br>- To be on TV?<br>- Yes, that's right.<br><br>I'll talk to her now,<br>and then we'll record it later.<br><br>- Okay, come in. I'll get you a towel.<br>- Great.<br><br>- Thank you.<br>- Come in, come in.<br><br>- We're only recording later.<br>- Okay.<br><br>So, the living room,<br>we decided to open up this wall here...<br><br>And there's my poor sweet husband.<br><br>- He looks just like Burt Reynolds.<br>- Yes.<br><br>And my daughter's room<br>is right down the hall there.<br><br>She's probably reading. She loves to read.<br><br>Or at least look at the pictures<br>of all the celebrities in her magazine.<br><br>All right.<br><br>It's starting again.<br><br>- I'll take that.<br>- Thanks.<br><br>Susanita, this lady wants to talk to you<br>for a little while.<br><br>Hi there. It's cold, huh?<br>And raining out.<br><br>You're Susanita, right?<br><br>That sure looks like<br>a cool magazine you have.<br><br>You have a lot of toys here.<br>Which one is your favorite?<br><br>The Barbie with the guitar and Lola.<br><br>Is that Lola?<br><br>She's very pretty.<br><br>Is this one yours?<br><br>Do you know who did this to your doll?<br><br>I bet you like TV, huh?<br><br>You know what?<br>I might be able to get you on TV.<br><br>But you have to help me first.<br><br>I need you to tell me<br>who did this to your doll.<br><br>Are you afraid? I don't think it was you.<br><br>No, it wasn't.<br><br>Can you tell me who did it?<br><br>I have a handsome boyfriend.<br><br>I see.<br><br>- And what's your boyfriend's name?<br>- Quimi.<br><br>Quimi.<br><br>He always says hi to me,<br>smiles, and he stops to talk to me.<br><br>Did your boyfriend do this to your doll?<br><br>Is he here now?<br><br>I see him when he goes into his house.<br><br>ALCAÑIZ THEATER<br><br>- And have you ever spoken to him?<br>- He loves me, and he's handsome.<br><br>Yes, he's very handsome.<br>You're a lucky girl.<br><br>I am lucky. He helps me when they hurt me.<br><br>- Quimi ever hurt you?<br>- No, he's my boyfriend.<br><br>Then who hurts you, sweetheart?<br><br>Shh...<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>Sweetheart, you can trust me.<br>Tell me who hurts you.<br><br>Need my glasses.<br><br>I really love your pajamas.<br>Would you lend them to me sometime?<br><br>That hurt?<br><br>Does it hurt here?<br><br>Okay if I see it?<br><br>Do you have these anywhere else,<br>sweetheart?<br><br>Who did this to you, sweetheart?<br><br>Oh, my goodness.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Oh, my God.<br><br>Do you like the rain?<br>How about we go out in the rain?<br><br>We won't tell anyone. It'll be our secret.<br>Only you and me will know.<br><br>Come on. Quietly, now.<br><br>No!<br><br>That's it. Give me your hand.<br><br>Come on now, sweetheart.<br><br>No, no, no. Don't do that.<br>What are you doing, Susanita?<br><br>I need to take my doll.<br><br>Listen to me, sweetheart.<br>We have to get out of here.<br><br>Shh. It's okay.<br><br>Coming.<br><br>All right.<br><br>- Who is it?<br>- Hi. Is Sagrario there?<br><br>- Who?<br>- My friend.<br><br>- We were together. Remember?<br>- No, there's no one here.<br><br>She said she was coming to see you.<br><br>She never came.<br><br>- That's strange. She, uh...<br>- Yeah.<br><br>It's just that there's a flood,<br>and I need to clean it.<br><br>I just wanted a mop<br>to clean up all the water.<br><br>Uh, uh, uh. U-Until the firemen get here.<br><br>Be very quiet now.<br><br>I appreciate this.<br>I'll bring it right back.<br><br>- Come in.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Shh...<br><br>Uh, could I...<br>Could I possibly get a glass of water?<br><br>Okay, go on. Hurry!<br><br>It's really coming down out there, huh?<br><br>But we can't complain about that, can we?<br>Because water is life.<br><br>Uh, could I get a towel,<br>just to dry off a bit?<br><br>No.<br><br>Well...<br><br>Uh...<br><br>I've always wanted to learn<br>how to make tortillas like that.<br><br>Uh. Could you show me how?<br><br>- I'm leaving, Mom.<br>- Shh.<br><br>Adding onions is a-a good idea,<br>assuming you like onions of course.<br><br>Uh, do you use onions<br><br>or something else?<br><br>- I'm going, Mama.<br>- Shh!<br><br>- You're gonna die!<br>- No!<br><br>Susanita, run!<br><br>No! No, no!<br><br>Paz! Wake up!<br><br>Think of your daughter.<br><br>Nighty night.<br><br>I can't leave you two alone<br>for one minute.<br><br>When we first started this project<br>and I saw how the two of us work together,<br><br>I knew I'd found the man<br>I wanted to spend the rest of...<br><br>Bye-bye, Susanita.<br><br>Don't worry about the girl.<br><br>She'll spend the night in a good,<br>safe residence.<br><br>And the mother?<br><br>The mother...<br><br>is coming down to the station<br>to answer a few questions,<br><br>but she seems completely disoriented.<br><br>- Thank you.<br>- Good night.<br><br>You okay, Paz?<br><br>Yeah. Never better.<br><br>Thanks a lot, miss. Thank you all.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>- Let's go.<br>- Ai.<br><br>Let's go.<br><br>Are you okay?<br><br>Let's get outta here.<br><br>God. I feel like<br>I got run over by a truck.<br><br>She really got you good.<br><br>Yeah, well, I guess, uh...<br><br>...it's all in a day's work.<br><br>Let's hope the two of you<br>will listen to me next time.<br><br>I told you right from the start<br>there was nothing here.<br><br>How about Quimi?<br><br>Apparently, he's a character<br>in her favorite TV series,<br><br>and the actor playing him<br>is doing a show at, uh,<br><br>well, the theater back there.<br><br>She sees him walk by her window<br>every night.<br><br>In the end,<br>it was that poor little girl's suffering<br><br>that was the key to everything.<br><br>- You sure you're all right to drive, Paz?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>A little headache isn't gonna stop me<br>from seeing my granddaughter.<br><br>You're a real masochist,<br>you know that, Paz?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Come on, phenomena. Let's go.<br><br>What?<br><br>I've never been so happy<br>to see you before.<br><br>That's the second time<br>I saved your life today.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Don't get used to it.<br><br>Hey, I don't wanna be<br>a pain in the ass or anything,<br><br>but that song was no coincidence.<br><br>It was the same song they used<br>in that car commercial, Sagrario.<br><br>Oh, shit. My ball.<br><br>- Oh, no.<br>- You're kidding me, right?<br><br>Gimme the keys.<br><br>Every muscle in my body is aching.<br><br>Yeah, same for my joints.<br><br>I'm looking forward to getting home...<br><br>...take a Valium and go to bed.<br><br>- I've never taken Valium before.<br>- You don't need to.<br><br>You're the most stable one of all of us.<br><br>- And the most boring.<br>- No.<br><br>A normal, conventional life<br>sounds pretty good to me right now.<br><br>I don't know what to tell you.<br><br>You don't have a cigarette, do you?<br><br>- I'm all out.<br>- No, but maybe in here.<br><br>- No, you're outta luck.<br>- Oh, God, it's cold.<br><br>Maybe Gloria has some.<br><br>- I don't think I have any in my pockets.<br>- I'll check her bag.<br><br>I don't believe this.<br><br>No. No, no, no.<br><br>- Come on.<br>- Hang on!<br><br>- What?<br>- Looks like a fuse blew.<br><br>- Gloria?<br>- Gloria!<br><br>Gloria?<br><br>Look.<br><br>I twisted my ankle here.<br><br>Gloria!<br><br>- Gloria?<br>- What the...<br><br>- What?<br>- It's here.<br><br>Gloria, this really isn't funny!<br>Where are you?<br><br>That's enough.<br>Come on out now. For God's sakes.<br><br>Gloria.<br><br>Shh.<br><br>Come here, Paz. Gimme a hand.<br><br>I wanna move this wardrobe.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>Okay?<br><br>- Come on.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- On three. Ready?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- Okay, one...<br>- One.<br><br>Two, three!<br><br>It's impossible.<br><br>- This thing weighs a ton.<br>- Shit. We didn't move it an inch.<br><br>- This is not good for my varicose veins.<br>- No. We can do this.<br><br>- Right?<br>- Let's try.<br><br>- I'm telling you, we can.<br>- All right, we can.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Come on.<br><br>- Yes, we can.<br>- Okay.<br><br>- On three.<br>- Ready.<br><br>- Okay, Paz, put your back into it now.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>One, two, three!<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Good job.<br><br>- What is this?<br>- Flashlight.<br><br>Oh, that's disgusting. Disgusting. Ai!<br><br>Ugh!<br><br>- Ew.<br>- Smells like rotten meat.<br><br>Sagrario,<br>we're definitely too old for this.<br><br>Way too old.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>- Let's go.<br>- Careful.<br><br>Paz!<br><br>- It's Gloria's jacket.<br>- Gloria!<br><br>Gloria, are you in here?<br><br>- Gloria!<br>- Gloria?<br><br>Come on.<br><br>You sure about this?<br><br>She saved my life twice.<br><br>Right. She never saved my life.<br><br>Gloria?<br><br>Gloria?<br><br>What the hell is this place?<br><br>Be careful.<br><br>Gloria, what are you doing?<br><br>Gloria?<br><br>Huh?<br><br>What's this? Huh?<br><br>Gifts for your grandchildren.<br><br>Don't. Don't talk about my grandchildren!<br><br>You hear me?!<br><br>What do you want?<br><br>Why did you take<br>the mother away?<br><br>I enjoyed playing<br>with her simple-minded daughter<br><br>and hearing her scream.<br><br>What do you need?<br><br>The three witches I have here.<br><br>I can help you.<br><br>But first, you have to free my friend.<br><br>Am I your friend?<br><br>Of course, you idiot.<br><br>Gloria, I know you can hear me.<br>You have to get outta there.<br><br>- Gloria, please.<br>- You don't have much time.<br><br>I've got all the time in the world.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>What is that?<br><br>Those are harlots<br>who sold their souls to the evil one.<br><br>They called themselves witches,<br><br>but they were nothing more than swindlers.<br><br>When they passed through my hands...<br><br>...their screams drowned out<br><br>the cracking sounds<br>of their bones breaking.<br><br>We've gotta wake her up, Sagrario.<br><br>- It's very dangerous.<br>- Then we've gotta do it now.<br><br>All right. You grab one side,<br>and I'll grab the other.<br><br>- You ready?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Only the three witches.<br><br>Long have I waited for you.<br><br>But have no fear,<br><br>a fair trial awaits you.<br><br>No!<br><br>One small jab is enough to prove to me<br><br>that there no longer remains<br><br>any trace of humanity left in her body.<br><br>What were you thinking<br>leaving me all alone?<br><br>- It's Father.<br>- No, no, no.<br><br>- Yes, it's him. Paz.<br>- No, Sagrario.<br><br>- You have to help us, Father. Please...<br>- Listen to me. Look at me.<br><br>- You have to help us.<br>- Look at me. It's not Father.<br><br>But I got an idea.<br><br>Gloria. Gloria, listen to me.<br><br>You have to find Father.<br><br>You have to find him. He'll help you.<br><br>Find him!<br><br>Hold on, Gloria.<br><br>I...<br><br>I don't have...<br><br>...the strength, Father.<br><br>Give me your hand.<br><br>Come with me.<br><br>Come.<br><br>This is...<br><br>The Vergara Palace.<br><br>Sarmiento, the man in the antique store<br>is the same...<br><br>He used me to find you.<br><br>- I'm sorry.<br>- Gloria, you have to confront him.<br><br>I can't.<br><br>I can't do it. He's-He's...<br>s-stronger than I am, Father.<br><br>Of course you can do it.<br><br>I-I don't wanna do this anymore, Father.<br><br>Your gift is much more powerful<br>than you think.<br><br>He's just like you.<br><br>You can see inside him.<br><br>I know.<br><br>I know I can.<br><br>But I don't want to, Father.<br>I don't want to!<br><br>It's the same process, only in reverse.<br><br>And what'll happen to you?<br><br>Just bring him to me.<br><br>Gloria, I know you can hear me.<br><br>- Concentrate!<br>- You've gotta get out, Gloria.<br><br>My dear, Gloria is not your friend.<br><br>No.<br><br>Because she has always known<br>where to find me.<br><br>Carlos?<br><br>But he can make sure<br><br>that we're together forever.<br><br>- Can you do that?<br>- I can do anything.<br><br>- Sagrario, he's trying to trick you.<br>- Shh. Quiet.<br><br>My fleur-de-lis, together at last.<br><br>- It's him. My love.<br>- It's not!<br><br>- My love, I missed your voice.<br>- Wait! Didn't you have a code?<br><br>Get him to say the code!<br><br>- I never stopped looking for you.<br>- The code, you fucking bastard!<br><br>What's the code?!<br><br>Naples.<br><br>Tolstoy.<br><br>Seventeen.<br><br>White.<br><br>Mikima.<br><br>- Yes, it is him.<br>- Nineteen.<br><br>No, it's not him.<br>Don't listen! It can't be him.<br><br>Sagrario, there's no way it's him!<br><br>Aah!<br><br>Aah!<br><br>What are you...<br><br>- Sagrario!<br>- Get away from me. I can't lose him now.<br><br>- Sagrario.<br>- Leave me alone.<br><br>Get off me! Get off me!<br><br>Sagrario.<br><br>Gloria, wake up!<br><br>Gloria, wake up!<br><br>Gloria, wake up!<br><br>Wake up!<br><br>Don't give up.<br>You can't let him win.<br><br>I'm so tired, Father. I can't.<br><br>I can't help you now.<br>Only you can do it.<br><br>Father, I'm begging you, don't do this.<br><br>It's up to you now. This is your time.<br><br>- Trust yourself!<br>- Gloria. I'm here, Gloria.<br><br>No, Paz, no. No, Carlos, no!<br><br>No, Carlos! No, please, Carlos!<br><br>For the love of God, don't go.<br><br>- It's not him!<br>- Stop it! Carlos, no!<br><br>Stop it!<br><br>No!<br><br>No, Carlos, please stay with me!<br><br>Stay with me! Stay with me!<br><br>Sagrario, you're all right.<br>You're all right. Sagrario?<br><br>Gloria, I beg you, wake up.<br><br>Wake up!<br><br>Wake up!<br><br>Gloria.<br><br>- I'm ready.<br>- No, Father! No, please...<br><br>No one escapes their destiny,<br>and that includes you.<br><br>I'm begging you, Father. I can't!<br><br>You have to! For yourself, for them.<br>For all the people who need you.<br><br>Bring him to me!<br><br>Aah! Gloria!<br><br>Gloria, breathe!<br><br>Breathe.<br><br>Oh, breathe.<br><br>Aah! Shit!<br><br>Gloria! Are you alive?<br><br>I'm okay. What happened?<br><br>You all right?

Bring it right in here!<br><br>Thanks for coming in.<br><br>Thank you, sir.<br><br>Yep.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Wait, what?<br><br>And that's supposed to be me?<br><br>The victim told us it was.<br><br>Well, that's crazy.<br><br>It's not me.<br><br>It's probably his cousin, Gavin.<br><br>That's who you should<br>be questioning.<br><br>I don't know what to tell you.<br><br>Let's start with where<br>you were last night.<br><br>He isn't a good guy.<br><br>Please, tell me what's going on.<br><br>You can trust me.<br><br>There's so much you don't know.<br><br>Annie: I... I don't know<br>what to believe anymore.<br><br>I don't... I don't think<br>that you'd do this.<br><br>But then I think about your<br>dad and I think about...<br><br>I'm not my dad.<br><br>Why your mom left.<br><br>And I don't want to be stressed<br>like this all the time, Ethan.<br><br>It's... it's not<br>good for the baby.<br><br>I don't understand<br>how you can't just...<br><br>Who's Rachel platt?<br><br>Why?<br><br>Annie: Who is she?<br><br>Jackson told me at the station<br>that he's worried about me.<br><br>Why?<br><br>He... he told me that<br>his mother's name<br><br>was Rachel platt.<br><br>Ethan: His mother?<br><br>He said that she was murdered.<br><br>Murdered?<br><br>I looked it up and a decade<br>ago a woman named Rachel platt<br><br>drowned in the lake.<br><br>Yeah, I know.<br><br>Annie: Okay. So what does this<br>woman have to do with you, Ethan?<br><br>We were...<br><br>Seeing each other.<br><br>We dated.<br><br>It was just a fling.<br><br>And she wasn't murdered here.<br><br>She committed suicide.<br><br>I always thought her son's<br>name was Christopher.<br><br>So, you were having an affair?<br><br>No, it wasn't an affair.<br><br>They basically weren't<br>even together anymore.<br><br>He didn't care about her.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Poor Jackson.<br><br>Poor Jackson then, but<br>now he's fucking crazy.<br><br>I mean, if he thinks<br>that she was murdered,<br><br>he probably thinks I had<br>something to do with that.<br><br>That's why he's trying to<br>ruin both of our lives.<br><br>Why didn't you tell me?<br><br>I didn't want to relive it.<br><br>How am I supposed to<br>bring that up to you?<br><br>She was crazy, Annie.<br><br>Jackson probably inherited it.<br><br>That's why he's so fucked up.<br><br>Annie: Of course,<br>he's fucked up.<br><br>He's been traumatized.<br><br>You... you can't just... oh.<br><br>Okay. You know what?<br><br>If you ever want to<br>tell me what the hell<br><br>is really going on,<br>Ethan, you let me know.<br><br>But until then, I want you gone.<br><br>Goddamn son of<br>a... fucking go...<br><br>Charles, how are you?<br><br>Welcome back, sir.<br><br>Do you live here?<br><br>Here, let me grab those for you.<br><br>Can I help you?<br><br>Yeah. I was... I said,<br>do you live here?<br><br>Yes, we do.<br><br>Is there a problem?<br><br>Yeah, I'm looking for Jackson.<br><br>Do you know a Jackson?<br><br>No.<br><br>You renting the<br>place for the summer?<br><br>No.<br><br>We live here.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>You can just tell me, because<br>I've... I've been here all week.<br><br>What do you mean you've<br>been here all week?<br><br>Ethan: Yeah, I've<br>been here all week.<br><br>- Ethan: Oh!<br>- Hey, dad.<br><br>Teddi, do you know this man?<br><br>Hey, I developed those<br>photos, that nice little ploy<br><br>that you had trying<br>to make like...<br><br>What are you talking about?<br><br>We had some little rendezvous<br>trying to get me in trouble.<br><br>You and Jackson's dad,<br><br>that was... That was<br>a great little trick.<br><br>I don't know who you are!<br><br>Because I'm still trying to<br>figure things out for myself.<br><br>I don't know who you are!<br><br>Sir! Tell her to<br>come back out here...<br><br>Because I have some questions.<br><br>You need to stay back.<br><br>- You need to stay back.<br>- I will stay back.<br><br>I'm just trying to figure<br>out who's house this is...<br><br>It's my house.<br><br>Where I've been all<br>week, ‘cause I am done<br><br>being fucked with and<br>I need information.<br><br>Leave now or I make you leave.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>I got you now, bastard.<br><br>Do you live here, sir?<br><br>Huh? No.<br><br>Uh, I... I left something here.<br><br>It's a friend of mine.<br><br>Who lives here?<br><br>Jackson, I think.<br><br>Police officer: Keep your<br>hands where I can see ‘em.<br><br>Look, here's another one.<br><br>“Rachel had some...<br><br>I mean, just read.<br><br>Look, Ethan didn't<br>have any involvement,<br><br>but it would just...<br><br>This doesn't prove anything.<br><br>I mean, it proves<br>that he's a liar.<br><br>Because he didn't tell you<br>that he was questioning<br><br>this kid's mom's death.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>I mean... I mean,<br>don't you think that's<br><br>something that should've come<br>up over the past five years.<br><br>It seems like a<br>pretty big deal to me.<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>Did you sleep last night?<br><br>No.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>And I think you are jumping<br>to conclusions a little bit.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>This is Ethan.<br><br>You know him.<br><br>I know.<br><br>I know.<br><br>But I just... I don't know.<br><br>These days I feel like I don't<br>really know him at all, so.<br><br>Uh.<br><br>Are you still<br>tracking his phone?<br><br>Yeah, I am.<br><br>And he knows?<br><br>Yeah, he knows.<br><br>He... he said that<br>he wanted me to.<br><br>He... he knows that I<br>still don't trust him.<br><br>Okay. So then I think you<br>should get out of the house<br><br>and stop thinking<br>about this stuff.<br><br>Okay?<br><br>Yeah, you're right.<br><br>You're right.<br><br>Ethan, do you know who's<br>property you broke in to?<br><br>It's where I was drugged.<br><br>I was trying to get<br>proof, evidence,<br><br>so I could get restraining<br>order so that this kid<br><br>can't come near me anymore.<br><br>It was Jefferson platt's.<br><br>The husband of Rachel platt?<br><br>Whose death you were questioned<br>about exactly 10 years ago?<br><br>And I had nothing to do with it.<br><br>That's what I'm trying<br>to tell you, guys.<br><br>This kid had some fixation.<br><br>He had some idea.<br><br>Ask his father.<br><br>Detective Landry: Jefferson platt died<br>from cancer three years ago, Ethan.<br><br>Why did your tutoring<br>company let you go?<br><br>Because they accused me<br>of um, assaulting him.<br><br>Detective Landry: So, that's twice you've<br>been accused of assaulting Jackson.<br><br>I'm gonna have to ask<br>you not to leave the area<br><br>for a few days.<br><br>We're gonna wanna<br>talk to you some more.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Yeah, I wouldn't do<br>anything now, because...<br><br>I just want my life back.<br><br>I just want my life back.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Jackson: How was<br>your evening, Ethan?<br><br>Splendid.<br><br>I've lost everything<br>thanks to you.<br><br>Jackson: So have I.<br><br>Thanks to you.<br><br>Listen...<br><br>Jackson: No, you listen.<br><br>I wanna talk.<br><br>No, I... I give up.<br><br>I don't want anything<br>to do with you.<br><br>All right? Just leave me alone.<br><br>Jackson: Meet me where she<br>died, unless you prefer<br><br>we continue this charade.<br><br>This was her favorite place,<br>where she felt most at peace.<br><br>But you already knew that.<br><br>Her body washed up<br>2 miles downstream.<br><br>But they didn't find<br>water in her lungs.<br><br>So someone killed her<br>and then pushed her in.<br><br>That was one theory<br>along with many others.<br><br>The heel from her shoe snapped<br>off and lodged right there.<br><br>Her head was slammed against<br>the deck with such force<br><br>that it cracked the wood.<br><br>The police determined that<br>that was the exact spot<br><br>that she died.<br><br>Detectives put that in<br>their confidential report.<br><br>My father got a copy, of course.<br><br>And so only he, myself,<br>and the murderer knows<br><br>that was the exact spot.<br><br>And here you are.<br><br>Oh, that's bullshit!<br><br>It only makes sense<br>this is where she died.<br><br>It's your property.<br><br>The current runs straight<br>to where she was found.<br><br>It doesn't take a genius<br>to figure out this is<br><br>where she killed herself.<br><br>Where are you going?<br><br>I want closure, Ethan.<br><br>I am sorry for your loss.<br><br>But your mom and<br>i's relationship,<br><br>it was a mistake.<br><br>And her death?<br><br>I had nothing to<br>do with it.

No idea.<br><br>She has been absent since a few days.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Are you sure Deb is dangerous?<br><br>From what you are saying, he seems like...<br><br>An idiot.<br><br>I know.<br><br>He is.<br><br>But I wonder where he went that night<br>at 3 with the headlights of his car off.<br><br>When I asked him indirectly<br>he reacted as if he knows nothing.<br><br>It could be his wife.<br><br>I cross checked it too.<br><br>Deb said his wife can't drive.<br><br>In fact, his wife can't do anything.<br><br>That is why she comes to<br>you in the college to be empowered.<br><br>Anyway, I know nothing<br>about his plan as of now. So...<br><br>I don't want to take any<br>risk before the main mission.<br><br>Kill him if you want to.<br><br>Make it look like an accident.<br><br>The common man's terror<br>is still looming large.<br><br>He has kind of turned<br>Kolkata into his playground.<br><br>Be it night or day,<br>he is targeting every woman who...<br><br>Who is this crazy man<br>killing woman randomly?<br><br>Why are they not able to nab him?<br><br>Do you actually want him caught?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>He should be caught and punished.<br><br>Do house chores and don't step out.<br><br>What will you do if you find him?<br><br>I'll give him a tight slap first.<br>And then get him arrested.<br><br>People who do not let their<br>girls and women step out of the house.<br><br>People who stop them taking<br>up jobs or even expressing their views.<br><br>Sir, what are you doing here?<br>Out.<br><br>Go out.<br><br>What are you doing here?<br><br>I have come to sell fish.<br><br>I am thinking of leaving<br>the force and start selling fish.<br><br>It is quite profitable.<br><br>Do I look crazy to you?<br><br>Strange. You report that there is<br>a threat to the CM and then you disappear.<br><br>Why aren't you taking our calls?<br><br>- I can't do it.<br>- You can't do it?<br><br>- I can't do it.<br>- What do you mean?<br><br>I got talked into this by you and started<br><br>But I had no idea of things that<br>were happening in my house since then.<br><br>But what is happening? Tell me.<br><br>There is something.<br><br>Tell me.<br><br>- There is a problem.<br>- What problem?<br><br>My husband is having an affair.<br><br>I want to fix it.

How?<br><br>She slipped in the bathroom<br>and her head hit the wall.<br><br>- Oh God.<br>- She died on the spot.<br><br>Show it.<br><br>- Yes. It's really nice.<br>- Yes, it's really good.<br><br>Tell me something.<br>What happened at the last minute?<br><br>??<br><br>Look, I have to go. I have to.<br><br>Listen. You can't do this to me. I...<br><br>I'll come tomorrow.<br>Come on. Come here, baby.<br><br>- Bye.<br>- Just a minute.<br><br>Go. Go.<br><br>Hey.

He wants to kill you.<br><br>Me? Like really?<br><br>Your actions are such.<br><br>Do you know who sent them after you?<br><br>Your girlfriend Ayesha.<br><br>What nonsense.<br><br>I should say that to you.<br><br>You like doing shady things, right?<br>Now save your life if you can.<br><br>But there is nothing like that.<br>I mean nothing.<br><br>You are not just a<br>cheat but shameless too.<br><br>You are still lying.<br><br>I know everything.<br><br>And if you are telling<br>the truth get off the car.<br><br>And the guy in the black car<br>will take care of you once and for all.<br><br>Oh no.<br><br>Go. Go.<br><br>You lied to me that you can't drive.<br><br>So what is this?<br><br>Leave alone driving.<br>You are making the car fly.<br><br>If I don't they will bump you off.<br><br>And there is a huge difference<br>between your lie and my lie.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>So what? Yes, I lied to you.<br><br>I ended up having an affair with Ayesha.<br><br>It happens. I am a man.<br><br>?? I am a man.<br><br>Did I tell you to join college? Did I?<br><br>Why did you stop the car?<br><br>What are you doing?<br>What... They are coming for us.<br><br>- Come out.<br>- Just a minute.<br><br>- Come out.<br>- What are you doing? Listen to me.<br><br>You scum.<br><br>Stop.<br><br>Durga.<br><br>??<br><br>Easy. Easy. It hurts.<br><br>Hey.<br><br>Call your boss. Tell her<br><br>that you have killed Deb.<br>Job is done.<br><br>Call her or do you want some?<br><br>I'm calling.<br><br>Call her.<br><br>Hello.<br><br>Boss, job is done.<br><br>- I have...<br>- I know.<br><br>But you will never see me again.<br><br>No, sir. No one's going to fire.<br><br>Why not?<br><br>Your cover is blown.<br>We have to eliminate him.<br><br>Just a minute. What's going on, Durga?<br><br>Four men have their guns<br>pointing at your husband.<br><br>- What the hell have you done?<br>- Shut up.<br><br>Quiet.<br><br>You are so shameless.<br><br>What have I done?<br><br>What have I done?<br><br>Did I have an affair?<br><br>What would you have done<br>if I had ended up having an affair?<br><br>You are responsible for<br>whatever that is happening, Deb.<br><br>What did you say to me in the car?<br><br>I got busy.<br>So you ended up having an affair?<br><br>I am a man. It happened.<br><br>I couldn't tell you that<br>I am special force agent.<br><br>So does that justify you having an affair?<br><br>I took you off the street.<br>Saved your life and got you here.<br><br>If not for me, you would have been dead.<br><br>You should thank me.<br>But you are blaming me instead.<br><br>Four men have their guns pointing at you.<br><br>No one's firing only because of me.<br><br>Got it?<br><br>A man would rather die<br>than let go of his male ego.<br><br>Should I shoot?<br><br>Should I shoot? Tell me.<br><br>Should I shoot?<br><br>Talk.<br><br>We have gagged him.<br>How is he going to talk?<br><br>It is the fault of us ladies.<br><br>You should not dedicate<br>yourself to this extent.<br><br>Because no matter how much<br>we do all we get to hear is<br><br>we are mere housewives.<br><br>Today you saw what a housewife can do.<br><br>Sir, take him.<br><br>Finish him.<br><br>Quiet.<br><br>Idiot.<br><br>If she had to kill you she would<br>not have saved you from certain death.<br><br>Stay here quietly till<br>the mission is complete.<br><br>Take him.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>Come on quietly.<br><br>- Come on.<br>- Come on.<br><br>- Durga.<br>- Yeah, sir.<br><br>I am sorry.<br><br>But I don't understand something.<br><br>Why does Ayesha want to kill Deb?<br><br>Sir, I feel the common man too had the same<br>misunderstand as you that Deb s the agent.<br><br>Because for him women are ass...<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>I guess common man didn't<br>want to take any chance.<br><br>So he must have told Ayesha to watch Deb.<br><br>This has worked in our favour.<br><br>We can get to the common<br>man through Ayesha.<br><br>Trident. 2...3...4.<br><br>and 2...3 and small.

<br><br>Would you forget that?<br><br>Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil!<br><br>In Berlin, a Jewish boy named Ernest Conrad<br><br>sits around the dinner<br>table with his parents,<br><br>who reassure each other<br>that Hitler is a fad,<br><br>destined to fail.<br><br>This cannot last.<br><br>That was the feeling; this<br>man coming is crazy, nuts.<br><br>How can the Germans listen to him?<br><br>What does he have to give?<br><br>Hitler's gift to Germany is a campaign<br><br>of racist terror.<br><br>My dad had his citizenship;<br><br>we all had our citizenships taken away.<br><br>His bank accounts confiscated<br>his businesses totally<br><br>near dissolution.<br><br>It's not only Jews who face persecution.<br><br>In March, 1936 Hitler's troops<br>sweep into the Rhineland,<br><br>a German region demilitarized<br>after World War One.<br><br>Nazis sterilize hundreds<br>of mixed race children<br><br>whom Hitler calls the Rhineland bastards.<br><br>Born to a German mother<br>and an African father,<br><br>Hans Hauck is 16-years old<br>when he is forcibly sterilized<br><br>by a vasectomy.<br><br>It couldn't escape from anybody<br><br>how increasingly the country<br>was not only militarized,<br><br>but terrorized.<br><br>In the summer of 1936,<br>Berlin hosts the Olympics.<br><br>Hitler and his Nazis look<br>to showcase the superiority<br><br>of the Aryan race.<br><br>they don't count on the<br>lightning fast American<br><br>Jesse Owens.<br><br>When Jessie Owens came into the stadium,<br><br>he got a bigger ovation than Hitler.<br><br>Owens obliterates the competition,<br><br>winning four gold medals.<br><br>His teammate Louis Zamperini<br>competes in the five-thousand<br><br>meter and loses.<br><br>But he runs a gutsy race, finishing strong.<br><br>Hitler insists on meeting him.<br><br>He shook my hands and said, Oh, the;<br><br>ah, the boy with the fast finish<br><br>I mean his face, his mustache,<br>the way he combed his hair.<br><br>I mean he looked like<br>somebody purposely uh,<br><br>did cosmetics on him for a comedy.<br><br>he was uh, to us, a dangerous comedian.<br><br>Japanese forces<br>overwhelm Shanghai and sweep<br><br>across Nanking.<br><br>In an orgy of violence, Japanese<br>soldiers brutalize the defeated<br><br>Chinese.<br><br>Chang Zhi Qiang watches in<br>horror as a Japanese soldier<br><br>stabs his mother in the chest.<br><br>When the massacre<br>ends after six terrifying weeks,<br><br>nearly two hundred thousand<br>corpses line on the streets<br><br>of Nanking.<br><br>In Washington, President<br>Roosevelt responds by cutting<br><br>back trade with Japan.<br><br>But the Japanese ignore the US<br>and keep expanding their empire.<br><br>In January, 1938, US ambassador<br>to Germany William Dodd returns<br><br>home and tries to sound the<br>alarm on the global threat<br><br>posed by Hitler.<br><br>Living in Europe these days is profoundly<br><br>discouraging.<br><br>Nazism and Fascism are<br>gaining ground everywhere.<br><br>This is a world crisis.<br><br>Dodd's words fall on deaf ears,<br><br>as most Americans would<br>rather turn a blind eye<br><br>to Europe's problems.<br><br>Armin Lehmann is a member<br>of the Hitler Youth,<br><br>being groomed as a future Aryan superman.<br><br>He says he was completely<br>unaware of the mayhem taking<br><br>place throughout the<br>expanding German empire.<br><br>People always ask, you know,<br><br>how could it have happened?'<br><br>you must have seen the<br>trucks drive up and loading<br><br>the Jewish people, et cetera.<br><br>I lived in a Nazi rent controlled area.<br><br>There was not a single Jewish family.<br><br>You couldn't see what happened<br>to the people who were not<br><br>in tune with the Nazis.<br><br>September, 1938.<br><br>European leaders convene in Munich.<br><br>They appease Hitler and let him<br>keep half of Czechoslovakia.<br><br>The settlement<br><br>of the Czechoslovakian problem,<br>which has now been achieved is,<br><br>in my view, only the prelude<br>to a larger settlement in which<br><br>all Europe may find peace.<br><br>Just six months<br>later, Hitler thumbs his nose<br><br>at the world and occupies what<br>is left of Czechoslovakia.<br><br>Beginning in 1939 Jews under<br>Nazi control must wear arm bands<br><br>identifying them as sub humans,<br>what Hitler calls Untermenschen.<br><br>To the east, in Moscow, Soviet<br>Dictator Josef Stalin decides<br><br>to join forces with Hitler, and<br>builds up a huge military force.<br><br>Behind closed doors, the two<br>powers draw up plans to carve up<br><br>Eastern Europe.<br><br>Poland sits in the cross-hairs.<br><br>The German war machine-the<br>infamous Wehrmacht-unleashes<br><br>a Lightning War of<br>overwhelming speed and power.<br><br>It's called Blitzkrieg.<br><br>Fast moving tanks punch gaping<br>holes in the Polish front lines,<br><br>while the German Air force, the Luftwaffe,<br><br>pummels the nation's Capital, Warsaw.<br><br>Within days, France and the British Empire<br><br>including India, Australia and<br>Canada declare war on Germany.<br><br>We were all very naïve,<br><br>and we always thought the war<br>would last only a limited period<br><br>of time.<br><br>After all we had powerful allies,<br><br>Great Britain and France and<br>they are going to make sure that<br><br>the war doesn't last very long.<br><br>In fact, the Allies<br>have no intention of saving<br><br>Poland, and abandon her to the enemy.<br><br>Hitler's ally Stalin now<br>orders his army to join<br><br>the Nazi invasion.<br><br>In just four weeks, 66-thousand<br>Polish corpses litter<br><br>the landscape.<br><br>On September 27th, Warsaw surrenders.<br><br>British and French Armies mass<br>on Germany's Western border.<br><br>In London, people wear gas<br>masks, anticipating an attack.<br><br>But the Allies stand down, and, once again,<br><br>hope to avoid conflict by doing nothing.<br><br>London residents like Rick<br>Brown steel themselves for war.<br><br>Instead he is surprised at what follows.<br><br>There were times during those early months,<br><br>which we call the phony war<br>because nothing went on.<br><br>And, we relaxed, the<br>home guard was disbanded,<br><br>people came back from being evacuated,<br><br>it was a very peculiar time.<br><br>The phony war soon yields to the real one.<br><br>To the South, along<br>their border with Germany,<br><br>the French man a series of<br>forts called the Maginot Line.<br><br>The defenses-supposedly<br>impenetrable-prove useless.<br><br>The Germans simply bypass<br>them and streak into France.<br><br>One more deadly thrust, and<br>Hitler will demand the surrender<br><br>of both France and Great Britain.<br><br>You ask, what is our policy?<br><br>It is to wage war, by sea, land and air,<br><br>with all our might and<br>with all the strength that<br><br>God can give us; to wage war<br>against a monstrous tyranny,<br><br>never surpassed in the dark<br>and lamentable catalogue<br><br>of human crime.<br><br>That is our policy.<br><br>By late May, 1940<br>hundreds of thousands of allied<br><br>troops huddle here near the<br>Northern French town of Dunkirk.<br><br>They're pinned down and<br>surrounded by the Wehrmacht,<br><br>their backs flush against<br>The English Channel.<br><br>It is absolute chaos.<br><br>You could not believe what a war is like,<br><br>'till you see what happened at Dunkirk.<br><br>Harry Garrett is<br>one those trapped soldiers.<br><br>It was just perpetual bombing, shelling,<br><br>strafing, and the-the sand dunes<br>where most of the boys were,<br><br>as was all being sprayed all day long.<br><br>Hitler and his Luftwaffe commander<br><br>Hermann Goring believe that<br>German air power alone<br><br>will force a massive and<br>devastating Allied surrender.<br><br>So just outside Dunkirk, the Germans halt<br><br>their ground advance.<br><br>Churchill seizes the moment,<br>calling on all British boat<br><br>owners to help the Royal Navy<br>rescue the trapped soldiers.<br><br>Over the course of nine days,<br>a ramshackle fleet of private<br><br>boats, as well as Royal Navy vessels,<br><br>rescues more than 330-thousand soldiers.<br><br>Harry Garrett escapes<br>from Dunkirk on a small<br><br>British destroyer.<br><br>We rushed onboard and we were lucky<br><br>we're some of the last onboard,<br>I think there must have been<br><br>about five-hundred,<br>four or five-hundred people<br><br>on this destroyer, I mean<br>this is a destroyer!<br><br>It was like a sardine can.<br><br>I believe there were about<br>270 ships sunk in the harbor.<br><br>That was so, so so sad.<br><br>You saw destroyers laying over<br>the side and ships laying over<br><br>the side.<br><br>And then uh, away we went.<br><br>Up to England it was so peaceful.<br><br>And there, were the cliffs of Dover.<br><br>I still feel that now.<br><br>Hitler's failure to<br>push the ground attack against<br><br>the Allies at Dunkirk stuns<br>Luftwaffe Pilot Heinz Migeod.<br><br>I know that our Generals were fuming.<br><br>It was nonsense.<br><br>We had allowed them to travel up<br>to Dunkirk so they could escape<br><br>to England.<br><br>In the aftermath of Dunkirk,<br><br>Winston Churchill emerges<br>as the face and voice<br><br>of British and Allied resolve.<br><br>We shall go on to the end.<br><br>We shall fight in France,<br>we shall fight on the seas<br><br>and oceans; we shall fight with<br>growing confidence and growing<br><br>strength in the air.<br><br>We shall defend our island<br>whatever the cost may be;<br><br>we shall fight on beaches,<br>we shall fight on the landing<br><br>grounds, we shall fight in the<br>fields, and in the streets,<br><br>we shall fight on the the hills.<br><br>We shall never surrender.<br><br>On June 10th, Italian<br>fascist leader Benito Mussolini<br><br>throws in with the Nazis<br>and declares war on France.<br><br>Four days later, German<br>troops march into Paris.<br><br>Triumphant German soldiers<br>unfurl the swastika<br><br>from the Eiffel Tower.<br><br>And France surrenders to Hitler.<br><br>The luftwaffe begins bombing<br>runs over the British coast<br><br>and shipping convoys.<br><br>Britain's Royal Air Force<br>alerted to impending attacks<br><br>by a sophisticated new radar<br>network-takes to the sky.<br><br>Including the deadly Hawker<br>Hurricane and the Supermarine<br><br>Spitfire.<br><br>From his secret underground<br>headquarters in London,<br><br>Churchill runs the war<br>and rallies his troops.<br><br>Let us therefore brace ourselves to our<br><br>duties, and for a thousand<br>years, men will still say,<br><br>this was their finest hour.<br><br>Bob Foster and<br>Geoffrey Wellum are barely out<br><br>of flight training when they're<br>ordered to protect the skies<br><br>from the invading Luftwaffe.<br><br>We were, I hesitate to say, the amateurs,<br><br>but we were, compared to the Germans,<br><br>a crowd of chaps pulled<br>together at the last minute.<br><br>With a desire to fly.<br><br>To protect the country.<br><br>You then looked at it and thought,<br><br>Good God, what are they doing over here?<br><br>Where do we start on this slaughter?<br><br>What do you do?<br><br>There's only one thing to<br>do, it's go straight in.<br><br>Have a quick squirt and then away.<br><br>Get down and think, God,<br>I got away with that one.<br><br>Let's go back and do it again.<br><br>And it was only after you<br>finished you thought, Whoa,<br><br>blymie, this is, this is bloody dangerous!<br><br>You can hear our own guns,<br><br>going like anything now.<br><br>Somebody's hit a German and he's<br>coming down in a long streak,<br><br>he coming down completely out of<br>control, a long streak of smoke.<br><br>Ah! There, you can hear our<br>anti-aircraft going at them now.<br><br>There are one, two, three, four, five, six<br><br>there are about ten German<br>machines dive-bombing the<br><br>British convoy, which is just<br>out to sea in the Channel.<br><br>Then, on September 7th, 1940,<br><br>the Nazis begin terror<br>attacks-indiscriminate bombing<br><br>of England's civilian population.<br><br>Londoners have a word<br>for it: the blitz.<br><br>In September 1940, the<br>Luftwaffe begins the merciless<br><br>bombing of London and<br>its civilian population.<br><br>By and large, people were very fatalistic,<br><br>what can we do?<br><br>If there's one up there with<br>my name on it, that's it.<br><br>Before it's over, nearly 40,000 men women<br><br>and children will be dead.<br><br>Not just in London, but throughout England.<br><br>It was up close and personal.<br><br>Very much so... when<br>you're 16, 17,<br><br>and you're asked to help<br>out in the docks of London,<br><br>which were devastated, lots of<br>casualties, bodies lying around.<br><br>Rick Brown is a<br>teenage member of the British<br><br>Home guard.<br><br>His job is to assist with the<br>rescue and recovery teams.<br><br>Immediate impressions are the ones<br><br>that stay.<br><br>I don't really believe that<br>any of us young kids realized<br><br>the enormity of what was happening.<br><br>German aircraft<br>relentlessly blast London and<br><br>other cities, but the British<br>fighters strike back hard.<br><br>And inflict enormous casualties.<br><br>After weeks of stunning losses,<br>Hitler realizes his Luftwaffe<br><br>alone cannot beat the British.<br><br>And while the blitz continues,<br>Hitler begins to turn<br><br>his attention on his supposed ally, Russia.<br><br>In September, 1940, Japan,<br>Italy and Germany sign<br><br>the tripartite pact and<br>forge the so-called Axis powers.<br><br>Their goal, quite simply,<br>is to rule the world.<br><br>And they seem well on their way.<br><br>In the summer of 1941, President<br>Roosevelt takes his biggest step<br><br>The US embargoes all metal shipments<br><br>and oil deliveries to the Japanese Empire.<br><br>The move cripples the Empire's industry,<br><br>and Japan now sees few options except war.<br><br>We Americans were looking at a threat<br><br>in Europe and a threat in the Pacific.<br><br>There was always the hope that<br>the oceans would protect us<br><br>on either side, but I don't<br>think my grandfather ever<br><br>believed you could rely on that.<br><br>Instead FDR prepares<br>for the oceans to become<br><br>battlefields.<br><br>On June 22nd, 1941 one brutal<br>Dictator double crosses another,<br><br>as Adolph Hitler breaks his<br>treaty with Josef Stalin<br><br>and invades the Soviet Union.<br><br>A vast army of 3 million German<br>troops unleashes a torrent<br><br>of death and destruction.<br><br>In the North, the Germans<br>lay siege here at Leningrad<br><br>and pound it into rubble.<br><br>Food supplies quickly dry up.<br><br>As the Russian winter sweeps in,<br>the city's survivors are forced<br><br>into desperate measures.<br><br>There were so many dead bodies out there.<br><br>And other people would rush to<br>the bodies like scavenger birds,<br><br>and they stripped them off clothes...<br><br>and they also cut flesh,<br>made ground meat out of it<br><br>and sold it or they ate it themselves.<br><br>But those who ate it ended up going insane.<br><br>Further South, German<br>troops battle to within fifteen<br><br>miles of the Capital, Moscow.<br><br>But temperatures descend to 25 below.<br><br>Weapons will not fire, and<br>soldiers freeze to death.<br><br>In early December, with<br>Hitler's armies withering,<br><br>the Soviets launch a vicious counterattack.<br><br>For the first time in the<br>war, the Germans retreat.<br><br>Moscow is saved.<br><br>The Naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii,<br><br>houses the bulk of America's Pacific fleet.<br><br>130 vessels rest on the placid waters.<br><br>390 aircraft park on adjacent airfields.<br><br>Sailors and pilots enjoy the<br>hospitality of nearby Honolulu,<br><br>as the first Sunday in December,<br>1941 dawns with light breezes<br><br>and clear skies.<br><br>The first thing I heard was music<br><br>and the disc jockey...<br><br>Daniel Inouye-a 17<br>year old high school student<br><br>living on Oahu-sits at<br>home listening to the radio.<br><br>I didn't know what he was talking about;<br><br>I thought it was just part of the show.<br><br>So I called my father,<br>and we looked out there.<br><br>And then three planes came<br>up, flying back from a run,<br><br>gray with red sun drop dots on the wing,<br><br>then I knew war was on.<br><br>At 7:48 AM, the<br>first of over 350 Japanese<br><br>dive-bombers, fighters and<br>torpedo planes sweep out<br><br>of the Hawaiian sky.<br><br>Some target the airfields where<br>planes, parked wing to wing,<br><br>are blasted into oblivion.<br><br>Others head to battleship row.<br><br>We could see that torpedo planes come up<br><br>and peel off you could pretty<br>much reach out and touch them;<br><br>we could see em in the planes<br>when the dive bombers were<br><br>hitting us, strafing us.<br><br>At Pearl Harbor, Don<br>Stratton and Clint Westbrook are<br><br>aboard the USS Arizona when an<br>enemy bomb penetrates the deck<br><br>and hits the ship's ammo dump.<br><br>We felt that, it shook the whole ship,<br><br>and then the ship exploded, then<br>we were caught in a ball of<br><br>flame that went about four,<br>five hundred feet in the air.<br><br>All I remember<br>is suddenly you see the whole<br><br>front of the ship disappear.<br><br>And then it was blank after<br>that because we were picked up,<br><br>spun around, dropped and everything else.<br><br>For two hours, the<br>Japanese air squadrons hammer<br><br>Pearl Harbor.<br><br>At 9:45AM, the<br>attack finally ends.<br><br>The local hospitals overflow<br>with the human carnage.<br><br>Japanese-American teenager<br>Daniel Inouye is a volunteer<br><br>assisting in the grisly cleanup.<br><br>I saw this body that was left over,<br><br>no head, I got myself a<br>box, put the parts in a box.<br><br>The father came back, he was out<br>doing some work, and he says,<br><br>I want to see my wife, and they<br>told me my wife is wounded.<br><br>And I told the man in<br>charge, the doctor, I said;<br><br>don't show it to him.<br><br>Well, he has the right to see his wife.<br><br>Okay. So he went into the<br>morgue, I opened the box,<br><br>he looked at that, he screamed<br>and spent the rest of his life<br><br>in the insane asylum.<br><br>The sneak attack destroys 188 aircraft,<br><br>sinks four battleships<br>and three destroyers.<br><br>Almost every US ship suffers some damage.<br><br>But luckily, the all important<br>fleet of aircraft carriers<br><br>are out to sea.<br><br>When the Arizona sinks to<br>the bottom of the harbor,<br><br>it takes 1102 trapped and<br>drowned seamen with it.<br><br>The next day, the United<br>States Congress declares war.<br><br>Yesterday, December 7th, 1941<br><br>a date which will live in infamy<br>the United States of America<br><br>was suddenly and deliberately<br>attacked by naval<br><br>and air forces of the

this<br>damn beach and die inland.<br><br>He stood up!<br><br>And hard to explain to you<br>what that little thing means.<br><br>And he led us off the beach,<br>right through the breach.<br><br>South

this bush and into<br><br>this trenchand I'd just take<br>'em down with the machine gun,<br><br>you know.<br><br>Compton jumps into the<br>trench and pulls the trigger.<br><br>Nothing happens.<br><br>And they looked at;<br><br>looked at me and were surprised<br>and they took off running and,<br><br>um, lucky as hell I, I just<br>pulled out this hand grenade and<br><br>pulled the pin on it and let<br>it fly and it came down right<br><br>on top of one of their heads<br>and went off and killed 'em both<br><br>with one hand grenade.<br><br>Also behind enemy lines,<br><br>paratrooper Earl Mcclung<br>discovers the advantage<br><br>of capturing or killing German officers.<br><br>With the Germans,<br>if you could get their officers<br><br>they were, ah, confused.<br><br>they were good soldiers as long<br>as they had somebody tell them<br><br>what to do.<br><br>But, uh, if they had to do<br>somethin' on their own,<br><br>they weren't all that great.<br><br>And while Mcclung and<br>his comrades honor the rules<br><br>of engagement with the<br>ordinary German soldiers,<br><br>their courtesy does not<br>extend to the murderous Nazis<br><br>of Hitler's elite forces, the Waffen SS.<br><br>The SS had already told us they wouldn't<br><br>take any airborne prisoners.<br><br>They wouldn't take us prisoner,<br>we wouldn't take them

a few weeks, 600-thousand<br>troops come ashore to take on<br><br>the Germans.<br><br>South of the beachhead,<br>Normandy's narrow roads are<br><br>lined by walls of rock, dirt,<br>and thick vegetation called<br><br>hedgerows.<br><br>We start hitting the hedgerows,<br><br>and when we hit the hedgerows,<br>that's when we, we were losing<br><br>a lot of men.<br><br>Too tall to

Allied<br><br>advance cold.<br><br>We'd be in one<br>hedgerow and the enemy would be<br><br>in the other hedgerow, which<br>the other hedgerow was about a<br><br>hundred feet, of open space.<br><br>We had to go in that open space<br>to crawl and get to the enemy<br><br>that was in the hedgerows firing at us.<br><br>These big you<br>know greedy hedgerows that were<br><br>not allowing them to breakout<br>or move with, great speed uh,<br><br>this was a big problem.<br><br>In order for armored<br>units to break through Normandy<br><br>and sweep across central France to Paris,<br><br>the hedgerows must be breached.<br><br>One ingenious American Sergeant<br>fashions iron-pronged extensions<br><br>that easily attach to<br>the front of the tanks.<br><br>The men call them

on<br>his sixth, his plane loses power<br><br>and crashes into the ocean.<br><br>The Japanese capture Zamperini<br>and toss him in a prison camp<br><br>on the island of Omori.<br><br>Louis finds himself in the<br>crosshairs of a sadistic guard<br><br>named Mutsuhiro Watanabe,<br>otherwise known as The Bird.<br><br>No matter where I was, he'd find me.<br><br>Oh, Zamperini, you come to attention last;<br><br>for no reason at all, I'm<br>punched out every day.<br><br>The Japanese do not<br>recognize the Geneva conventions<br><br>and brutalize their prisoners.<br><br>Over 27% of POW's die<br>in Japanese captivity.<br><br>Zamperini's misery serves as<br>amusement for the guards.<br><br>He line up five or six officers.<br><br>Then he'd get the enlisted<br>men to insult us and have<br><br>the enlisted men punch us out.<br><br>if they didn't hit us hard, they got hit.<br><br>So we'd say, Hey go ahead and hit us hard.<br><br>But that was the Bird.<br><br>At the end of August,<br><br>Patton was really at the<br>height of his powers.<br><br>He'd covered several<br>hundred miles of territory,<br><br>and conquered half of France,<br>and liberated Paris in less than<br><br>four weeks.<br><br>The, uh, tank conditions were ideal.<br><br>We had long nights, short<br>days, and the ground<br><br>was absolutely dry.<br>The tanks could go anywhere.<br><br>Patton

miles<br><br>south of Bastogne Eisenhower<br>just didn't believe it.<br><br>My grandfather passed along<br>the code words to his chief of<br><br>staff, 'play ball' and three<br>divisions turned and

of bed baby,<br>let's get on down to the boutique<br><br>I'll bring back somethin'<br>that's funky but chic<br><br>Oh!<br><br>Yeah!<br><br>Yeah!<br><br>Yeah!<br><br>All right, boys!<br><br>Oh, yeah!<br><br>All right.<br>Oh, yeah.<br><br>You were the lead singer<br>of the New York Dolls.<br><br>A lot of people credit you guys<br><br>with really helping to<br>start the punk movement.<br><br>Well, yeah, but<br>inadvertently, like,<br><br>we didn't do it on purpose.<br><br>We were in Newcastle and<br>it's a place in England<br><br>where they make this beer<br>called Newcastle Brown Ale.<br><br>And we were young men<br>and we had a reputation<br><br>of being able to hold our booze.<br><br>So they say, ""Oh, boys, you<br>gotta try the local brew.""<br><br>And they give you<br>these gigantic cans of<br><br>Newcastle Brown Ale.<br><br>And we're at like the<br>Newcastle Polytechnic Institute<br><br>or something for a show.<br><br>We're drinking these things.<br>""Have another one.""<br><br>OK, Ok, another one.<br><br>So we drank maybe 10<br>of these things... and...<br><br>Maybe, maybe 10.<br><br>We go on stage to play and<br>everything is going fine.<br><br>All of a sudden, the drummer<br>barfs about 12 gallons<br><br>of Brown ale onto<br>his snare drum,<br><br>but he keeps playing.<br><br>And so, you know, a good dollop of it<br>hits me right in the nose<br><br>and you know how that is,<br>it's like a chain reaction.<br><br>Yeah, I know how that is.<br><br>Why would I know how that is?<br>I don't know how that is.<br><br>Well, I let loose and then the<br>bass player let loose,<br><br>the guitar player let loose,<br><br>the audience was like...<br><br>Everybody's throwing up<br><br>and at the end of the song,<br>everybody's like, ""Yeah!""<br><br>And they thought it<br>was part of the act<br><br>and then all the kids in<br>England started doing this.<br><br>It became the rigor of, uh...<br><br>Oh, we gotta throw<br>up like The Dolls!<br><br>You know, that kind of thing.<br><br>And that's... that's how the<br>punk movement was born.<br><br>I would say that was the...<br>if you wanted to bring it<br><br>down to a moment in time,<br>that was the moment.<br><br>It's super sensuous,<br>transcendental<br><br>something not to be<br>explained in rational terms.<br><br>It's the Mansion of Fun show.<br><br>I hear that melody<br><br>On the street<br><br>My melody<br><br>Soft and sweet<br><br>Your melody, would you<br>sing that song to me<br><br>Melodies hauntin' me<br><br>Memories just repeat<br><br>Your melodies even<br>haunt me in my sleep<br><br>I tried to show you,<br>you just couldn't see it<br><br>I tried to tell you, but your<br>heart couldn't hear it<br><br>I tried to love you, but ya<br><br>Your heart had to slip away<br><br>Now that melody's<br>hauntin' me<br><br>Melody got that beat<br><br>The memory just<br>repeats in my mind<br><br>A melody, where I dance<br><br>In the place<br>that I find romance<br><br>Your melody just won't<br>give me a chance<br><br>I tried to show you, but<br>your heart couldn't see it<br><br>I tried to tell you, but<br>your heart couldn't hear it<br><br>I tried to love you, but<br>your heart had to slip away<br><br>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah<br><br>Melody<br><br>Yeah, yeah, yeah<br><br>Melody<br><br>Yeah, yeah, yeah<br><br>Well certain songs<br>I just can't take it<br><br>They start to play and<br>my old heart starts achin'<br><br>Certain songs,<br>I just can't fake it<br><br>They start to play and<br>I just want to break 'em<br><br>I just can't take it<br><br>When I hear them<br>play that song<br><br>Yeah that melody<br><br>Haunting me<br><br>A tender rhapsody,<br>soft and sweet<br><br>The memory follows me<br><br>'Til it's insanity<br><br>Driving me<br><br>Now my melody's<br>on the street<br><br>Oh, melody,<br>soft and sweet<br><br>Oh, melody<br><br>Yeah, yeah, melody<br><br>Yeah, my melody<br><br>Yeah, yeah, yeah,

back in the States<br><br>I'm stranded in the jungle,<br>I'm afraid of it all<br><br>Wondering how I could<br>get a message back home<br><br>But how was I to know that<br>the wreckage of my plane<br><br>Had been picked up<br>and spotted<br><br>By the girl<br>on Lover's Lane<br><br>I said, meanwhile,<br>back in the States<br><br>Baby, baby<br><br>Let's make romance<br><br>Your old-time love<br>hasn't got a chance<br><br>I said he's stranded in the<br>jungle, bad as he can be<br><br>Come on, pretty darling,<br>just you and me<br><br>Oh yeah, oh yeah<br><br>Meanwhile, back in the jungle...<br><br>Ahhhh, ahhhh<br><br>Ahhhh, ahhhh<br><br>Why come<br>to a New York Dolls show?<br><br>A lot of kids are<br>like whipped dogs<br><br>and they feel like they're<br>really terribly alienated<br><br>And I think we give 'em a<br>feeling that they're not<br><br>the same people that<br>feel these feelings<br><br>not the only people<br>that feel these feelings<br><br>and that they're not alone.<br><br>They all can come<br>together on our show<br><br>and see each other<br>and meet each other.<br><br>There's a thousand<br>bands that are coming up<br><br>like from the streets,<br>from the ghetto.<br><br>1,2,3,4!<br><br>Trash, go pick it up<br><br>Take them lights away<br><br>Trash, go pick it up<br><br>Don't take your life away<br><br>Trash, go pick it up<br><br>Don't try to take<br>my knife away<br><br>And please don't you<br>ask me if I love you<br><br>If you don't know<br>what I'm doing<br><br>What you know is<br><br>Trash, go pick it up...<br><br>Now, is it<br>true that you were president<br><br>- of their fan club?<br>- No. Not at all.<br><br>Well, were... were you<br>involved in their fan club?<br><br>No. Not even slightly.<br><br>- A member?<br>- Not even a member.<br><br>Tempted to send off<br>of town for four months?<br><br>- Yes, it's all true.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- It's all true.<br>- It is true.<br><br>You were in the fan club,<br>you denied it.<br><br>- But it's true, isn't it?<br>- I, I, I, I, I... was the fan club.<br><br>I was the fan club.<br><br>And what was it that drew<br>you to The New York Dolls?<br><br>Well, they were very violent.<br><br>They were very witty and<br>they were very intelligent.<br><br>And as you know, most pop<br>stars are not very intelligent.<br><br>and they're not very witty<br>and not very violent.<br><br>Right.<br><br>And why-ha-hy ha-ha ha-hy<br><br>Why do you hang around<br><br>I'm so sorry<br><br>I-I-I-I'm so sorry<br><br>It was a good lay, good lay<br><br>Ah ha<br><br>Do you remember<br>when you first saw the Dolls?<br><br>Mm, yes. I had gone to<br>see them live in '72,<br><br>but their drummer had<br>died three days earlier.<br><br>And everybody was expecting<br>the Dolls to walk on the stage.<br><br>And of course they didn't.<br><br>There was just suddenly an<br>announcement that<br><br>Billy had died<br>and everybody just collapsed.<br><br>And then the next<br>encounter was television.<br><br>They, they appeared<br>very famously<br><br>on The Old Grey Whistle Test<br><br>which in those very<br>dark days of '73<br><br>was a fantastic vision.<br><br>People forget how<br>absolutely dank things were,<br><br>how dank life was<br>and pop art was.<br><br>And there was no,<br><br>there was no sense of danger<br>within pop music at all.<br><br>But I was obsessive.<br><br>I was, I was<br>ridiculously obsessive.<br><br>This, this was the band for me.<br><br>This was the turning<br>point for me.<br><br>Why have so few<br>people heard New York Dolls?<br><br>This is<br>a blighted band.<br><br>I'd almost say cursed<br>because if you listen to,<br><br>if you listen to, to,<br>to the... the music they made,<br><br>every single song is<br>really a hit single.<br><br>And there's no reason on earth<br>why it shouldn't have happened.<br><br>But because they were connected<br><br>with drugs and absurdly<br>transgender issues.<br><br>So here were boys who were<br>calling themselves ""Dolls""<br><br>and they looked like<br>prostitutes, male prostitutes,<br><br>which at the time,<br>you have to remember,<br><br>it was a long time ago<br><br>and all... and all of that kind<br>of thing was really taboo.<br><br>And if a man walked<br><br>down the street wearing<br>women's clothes,<br><br>he could be arrested<br>and thrown into jail.<br><br>That's why they only made<br>two studio albums.<br><br>And for a group who<br>did so little really<br><br>and existed for such<br>a short amount of time,<br><br>their impact has<br>been extraordinary.<br><br>And the music, because it was<br>such fantastic pop music,<br><br>it, it just seemed to me like<br><br>the absolute answer<br>to everything.<br><br>Which of course...<br>too dangerous.<br><br>I just want<br>to be like very welcoming.<br><br>'Cause the way the society is,<br>I mean, it, it was set up is<br><br>like very strict, like...<br><br>straight, gay...<br><br>whatever, vegetarian,<br><br>whatever you want to, you know,<br>anything you want to say.<br><br>I just wanted to kind of like<br>bring those walls down and...<br><br>and have a party<br>kind of a thing.<br><br>Oh, man, this is great.<br>This is very nice.<br><br>This is a classy bo?te,<br>the Caf? Carlyle.<br><br>And we are starting our<br>semi-annual bisexual...<br><br>What am I talking about?<br><br>Bi-annual residency.<br>And the cafe called Mara,<br><br>who runs this whole<br>shebang up here and asked<br><br>if we'd like to come back.<br><br>She said, ""Yes.""<br><br>No, we love it here because,<br>I'll tell you why,<br><br>you take the elevator to work.<br><br>My whole life I've<br>been schlepping.<br><br>Oh, in some ungodly conveyances.<br><br>Then came the... the question of<br>what kind of a repertoire we<br><br>would present because you have<br>to have a new one every year.<br><br>And I was in no mood<br>for learning 20 songs.<br><br>There's only so<br>many hours in a day.<br><br>So we decided that we<br>would do Buster Poindexter...<br><br>That's me...<br><br>singing the songs of<br>David Johansen... that's me.<br><br>Because I know those songs.<br><br>And so here we are, both of us.<br><br>And... tonight, I'm gonna do<br>songs that I wrote or co-wrote,<br><br>I guess from when I was a<br>teenager, all the way up to now.<br><br>And the one thing I could say,<br>the unifying thing<br><br>of my existence, is that there's<br>always been plenty of music.<br><br>That's nice. Very nice.<br><br>Feeling a great<br>sadness today<br><br>I don't want to shush<br>it or shoo it away<br><br>It belongs to the whole<br>world, the boys and girls<br><br>It ain't just mine<br><br>Like joy and love,<br>it's always there<br><br>I don't know how I tune in,<br>or why that I care<br><br>But I can't pretend it<br>don't feel like the end<br><br>And everything is fine<br><br>I feel exiled<br>from the divine<br><br>Me and these sad<br>friends of mine<br><br>We're just waiting down here,<br>drinking beer<br><br>And losing time<br><br>Well, I hear<br>plenty of music<br><br>I see superfluous<br>beauty everywhere<br><br>Why should I care<br><br>What does it matter to me<br><br>Yeah, yeah.<br><br>All right, now.<br><br>The myth of life<br>is a song<br><br>Yeah!<br><br>And nature, too,<br>that's the song<br><br>All right.<br><br>Don't you destroy the song<br><br>'Cause when<br>the song is gone<br><br>You'll be gone too<br><br>I don't know<br>how it went astray<br><br>Seem like the whole world<br>is an ashtray<br><br>Floatin' around<br><br>Some broken-down,<br>low-end galaxy<br><br>I don't know what I<br>did to get sent here<br><br>Must have been some<br>bad that I done<br><br>There in the world gone mad<br><br>Feeling sad<br><br>I guess I'm sorry<br><br>I don't need<br>no one to love me<br><br>Or place theirself above me<br><br>What does it matter,<br>I don't need a ladder<br><br>What's it to me<br><br>I hear plenty of music<br><br>I see superfluous beauty<br><br>Everywhere<br><br>So why should I care<br><br>What does it matter<br><br>Yeah, I hear<br>plenty of music<br><br>I see superfluous beauty<br><br>Everywhere<br><br>Why should I care<br><br>What does it matter to me<br><br>What's it matter to me<br><br>Nothing matters to me<br><br>What's the matter with me<br><br>Oh!<br><br>Beautiful.<br>Beautiful.<br><br>Poor boy<br><br>Poor boy<br><br>Poor boy long way from home<br><br>When I was down<br>in Louisiana<br><br>Just doing as I please<br><br>Now I'm in Texas<br><br>I got to work or leave<br><br>Poor boy<br><br>You<br>actually knew Harry Smith?<br><br>Well, I didn't really know him,<br><br>but I met him a couple of times.<br><br>You went to<br>his place at The Chelsea?<br><br>Yeah, probably, yeah.<br><br>What<br>was his room like?<br><br>It was kinda like, you know,<br><br>a speed den,<br>I think at the time.<br><br>You know, like when I was a kid<br><br>you would go to The Chelsea<br><br>and you'd get stuck<br>in there for like a week,<br><br>going to different<br>people's rooms and stuff.<br><br>I was probably 18 at<br>the time, you know,<br><br>so I would like to go see<br>people that were generally older<br><br>and could impart<br>some kind of wisdom.<br><br>Was Harry<br>Smith one of those people?<br><br>Well, I, you know...<br><br>He could have been.<br><br>- Who's this?<br>- Who's who?<br><br>This guy.<br><br>- Oh, that's Harry Smith.<br>- Oh.<br><br>He was, you know,<br>like a polymath.<br><br>This guy was into a lot<br>of really good shit.<br><br>He would be into something<br><br>and then he would be like<br>through with it, you know?<br><br>When he was young,<br>he started out,<br><br>he would hang with<br>the Lummi people.<br><br>He recorded their<br>traditional music<br><br>and he made a lot of like<br>experimental films later on.<br><br>He would put ads in<br>newspapers around the country,<br><br>asking people if they<br>wanted to get rid<br><br>of their old 78s that<br>were in the attic.<br><br>I mean, you know,<br>he was the kind of guy<br><br>who would collect string,<br>you know what I mean?<br><br>His record collection<br>is pivotal<br><br>in the American music<br>and rock and roll<br><br>and the folk boom in the 50s.<br><br>Everybody who wanted<br>to be a folk singer<br><br>in the 1950s would learn<br>songs from those records.<br><br>And there was a lot of<br>different kinds of songs.<br><br>He picked like, you<br>know, really strange tunes.<br><br>You<br>recorded a lot of songs<br><br>from the Harry Smith<br>record collection<br><br>and you named your<br>band The Harry Smiths.<br><br>Would you say that he's<br>someone who inspired you?<br><br>Not at all.<br><br>Well, you're very averse to...<br><br>No, because he was such<br>a grouch, this guy.<br><br>I mean, I liked a lot<br>of the stuff he did,<br><br>but I never thought, ""Oh wow,<br>I wish I could do that.""<br><br>Poor boy<br><br>Poor boy<br><br>I grew up<br>in Staten Island<br><br>in a house that my<br>grandfather built.<br><br>We had a lot of<br>records in the house.<br><br>Music was on all the time.<br><br>You know, sometimes<br>there would play a show<br><br>while we were having dinner<br>or something, you know.<br><br>What<br>about your dad singing?<br><br>What about it?<br><br>Like,<br>did you sing with<br><br>your dad around the house?<br><br>Uh no, not so much,<br>but he was a very good singer.<br><br>He used sing like light opera<br>like Gilbert and Sullivan.<br><br>He knew a lot of operas.<br><br>How old were you<br>when you had your first band?<br><br>Thirteen or fourteen.<br><br>We used to play at you know,<br>like school dances<br><br>and we used to go into<br>the ""Battle of the Bands.""<br><br>We always used to come in<br>second because this other group<br><br>from the ass end<br>of Staten Island,<br><br>used to play these songs<br>with like The Ventures,<br><br>like with the guitars<br>behind their head,<br><br>which I always saw felt like,<br>that's really a lame gimmick.<br><br>But... they won every time.<br><br>I remember the first<br>time we played<br><br>I remember the first song,<br>Boogaloo Down Broadway<br><br>by the fantastic Johnny C.<br><br>- You know that song?<br>- No.<br><br>Baby, oh baby<br><br>Boogaloo down Broadway<br><br>Yeah, yeah, funky Broadway<br><br>I closed my eyes for<br>the whole first song...<br><br>and then I could hear<br>them all applauding<br><br>and I opened my eyes<br><br>and I was like,<br>""Oh, they like it.""<br><br>OK, here we go.<br><br>I'm gonna just reminisce<br>for a minute here, but...<br><br>...it's my birthday today.<br><br>And I'm such a<br>sentimental old fool.<br><br>I was recalling how<br>when I was like 16,<br><br>my friends and I went to...<br><br>and I had a very interesting<br>group of friends,<br><br>kind of like Maynard G. Krebs<br>type people.<br><br>The New York Avant<br>Garde Festival was...<br><br>held on the ferry boat.<br><br>So we went to see<br>Charlotte Moormon<br><br>play the cello topless.<br><br>That's the kind of<br>crowd we ran with.<br><br>We liked a little culture<br>with our pornography.<br><br>So a friend of mine said,<br>""I work for a guy over there<br><br>and he's looking for<br>somebody else to work there.""<br><br>It was a little store on<br><br>St. Mark's Place<br>called Matchless<br><br>and it was run by a<br>fellow named Lore Wilson.<br><br>And it was nice.<br><br>They had tchotchkes,<br>you know, around the store.<br><br>And I was sent down to<br>the basement to work,<br><br>which was like...<br>very dark, dank, stonewalls...<br><br>like it was dug out of rock...<br><br>with moss and water<br>dripping down.<br><br>It was a Dickensian hell.<br><br>And my job was to cut logos<br><br>off of beer cans and<br>soda cans, like Pepsi,<br><br>and then put a fastener on it<br>and make earrings out of them.<br><br>It was kind of pop art jewelry.<br><br>But I noticed that along<br>the walls there were racks<br><br>and on the racks were<br>these big fat lush boas.<br><br>There was a huge<br>sequined phallus.<br><br>There was... all kinds of<br>headdresses and costumes.<br><br>And so I said, ""Lore, what's the<br>deal with this...<br><br>cosplay stuff over here?""<br><br>And he said, ""Oh, well<br>I'm the costume designer<br><br>for the Ridiculous Theater<br><br>and these are costumes<br>for their next production.""<br><br>I think it was<br>Whores of Babylon,<br><br>or Conquest of the Universe,<br>or something.<br><br>So I said, ""Oh, can I go<br>to the rehearsal with you?""<br><br>And he said, ""Oh yes.""<br><br>And then I met the most<br>fabulous people I think<br><br>that I could ever have<br>imagined at that point.<br><br>So I said, ""Lore, I'm not<br>gonna be coming back tomorrow.""<br><br>I was like, ""I'm gonna stay<br>over here at the theater.""<br><br>And... sometimes I<br>would do the sound and...<br><br>sometimes I<br>would do the lights,<br><br>sometimes I would nod out<br>while I was doing the sound<br><br>and Charles Ludlam<br>would have to like...<br><br>give me my cue<br>like three times.<br><br>""And then the thunder rolled.""<br><br>""The thunder rolled!""<br><br>And then I would go.<br><br>Sometimes I was a spear<br>carrier and went on stage.<br><br>It was just great.<br><br>And one time I was sharing<br>a dressing room table<br><br>with Candy Darling and<br>Black-Eyed Susan was complaining<br><br>about her waitressing job.<br><br>And Candy said, ""I've been a<br>lot of low things in my life,<br><br>but I've never<br>been no waitress.""<br><br>I went from hell to heaven,<br>you know, it was fantastic.<br><br>OK, baby.<br><br>Yeah, yeah.<br><br>Temptation to exist<br><br>Give me another kiss<br><br>Tell me how you love me<br><br>A mesmerizing kiss<br><br>That I can't resist<br><br>Say I'm the way you want me<br><br>So I can breathe<br>your perfume<br><br>Dancing with you<br>'round the room<br><br>Long after a masquerade<br><br>All right, baby.<br><br>Stripped of<br>facade and costume<br><br>The drag with being born<br><br>It's really not a thorn<br><br>Baby, it's a dagger<br><br>Most people would deny<br><br>Say it's a piece of pie<br><br>To you it doesn't matter<br><br>I hear about all<br>the sad affairs<br><br>Up on the heights<br>of despair<br><br>Someone's always perishing<br><br>Ah...<br><br>By the self they've assumed<br><br>All right Ray, let's go.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>Yeah, baby!<br><br>Aw yeah.<br><br>Heh-hey!<br><br>Temptation to exist<br><br>Obsession to persist<br><br>Death-defying romance<br><br>Give me another kiss<br><br>Show me what I miss<br><br>Baby, since our last dance<br><br>So I can get back in tune<br><br>All right.<br><br>Dancing with you<br>'round the room<br><br>Long after the masquerade<br><br>All right, baby.<br><br>With no facade, no costume<br><br>Here we go, boys.<br><br>Ray Grappone, everybody,<br><br>Ray Grappone on<br>whistling and drums.<br><br>Ray, I would whistle<br>with you anywhere.<br><br>Well, thank you, boss man.<br><br>You know, Ray and I<br>have been practicing<br><br>in the shower and it's<br>coming together really well.<br><br>- Oh, Thomas!<br>- Did he say that?<br><br>- Thomas everybody.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>You are a living legend.<br><br>Oh, oh, oh...<br>God bless you.<br><br>If you need anything here<br>at the Caf?

Carlyle.<br><br>But still up there<br>in the top two.<br><br>It was a lot like this actually.<br>It was a lot like this.<br><br>Some of the greatest queens<br>you'd ever wanna meet.<br><br>Oh, my god.<br><br>I remember one night...<br><br>I believe it was...<br><br>Penny, you'll correct<br>me if I'm wrong.<br><br>Because Penny Arcade was<br>there as well this evening.<br><br>It was Ingrid Superstar?<br><br>It was you, Bill Vehr and<br>Ingrid Superstar and me.<br><br>OK, Penny and I,<br>my friend Bill Vehr<br><br>from the Ridiculous Theater.<br>The author of Turds in Hell.<br><br>He was my best<br>friend at the time.<br><br>We were biffing.<br><br>And Ingrid Superstar.<br><br>And Ingrid said,<br><br>""You're on a trip.<br>You're on a trip.<br><br>You're on... everybody here<br>is on a trip except for me.""<br><br>And Bill very calmly said,<br>""But, Ingrid Superstar,<br><br>you took eight Tuinals.""<br><br>She said, ""Yeah, but<br>I'm not on a trip.""<br><br>Anyway, I found that<br>amusing, you know.<br><br>So much so, that I recall<br>that after all these years.<br><br>Something about certain<br>turns of phrase in language<br><br>that are peculiar to each of us.<br><br>Written<br>for you, Tina Louise.<br><br>- What's my real name, Duchess?<br>- I don't know.<br><br>You really like to<br>destroy people, don't you?<br><br>Everybody you<br>would meet would be alive,<br><br>freewheelin' and so<br>much stuff going on.<br><br>So that after you've<br>come six times, six times,<br><br>you're gonna find out<br>that you're Superman, you see.<br><br>There's something<br>wrong with this.<br><br>Charles Ludlum came<br>to the show one night<br><br>and he just said, ""I'm<br>having a personality crisis.""<br><br>And I thought,<br>""That's really good.""<br><br>And I kind of<br>remembered it, you know.<br><br>Here, let me<br>pull through the bottom.<br><br>I remember when I moved<br>into my first apartment,<br><br>which was a seventh-floor walkup<br>on the Hells Angels block.<br><br>I turned on the radiator<br>and it just like started hissing steam<br><br>I really didn't<br>know what to do about it.<br><br>And so, I knocked on, I guess<br>it was my neighbor's door,<br><br>or two doors down<br>and this guy came in.<br><br>He was like a college professor,<br>but kind of like, you know,<br><br>a hip college<br>professor kind of guy.<br><br>He was very nice<br>and very political.<br><br>He told me that I should<br>check out his group,<br><br>which happened to be the Up<br>Against the Wall Motherfuckers.<br><br>I said, ""OK.""<br><br>And he kind of like would<br>encourage me<br><br>because apparently,<br><br>I had the stuff to rally the<br>street if something went down,<br><br>so I used to stay on the corner,<br><br>like go climb up a<br>lamppost and say,<br><br>""We're not gonna let these cops,<br><br>blah blah blah blah<br>blah blah blah.""<br><br>And everybody'd<br>be like, ""No, no.""<br><br>And then there'd be<br>like some kind of a...<br><br>skirmish or whatever.<br><br>And my mother said to<br>me about them, she said,<br><br>""You know what you are?<br>You're a commie dupe.""<br><br>I had to<br>think like, ""Yeah, maybe.""<br><br>Maybe I was.<br><br>There were so many characters<br>on St. Mark's Place in,<br><br>you know, '69,'70.<br><br>I used to really like Abbie<br>Hoffman a lot when I was a kid.<br><br>Did<br>you meet him first?<br><br>Yeah, I used to see<br>him all the time.<br><br>He was very personable.<br><br>We planted a tree in the<br>middle of St. Mark's Place.<br><br>He was the instigator of that.<br><br>The ruse of it was<br>that we need more trees<br><br>on St. Mark's Place.<br><br>He said, ""Where're<br>we gonna get a tree?""<br><br>I said, ""They got trees<br>all over Staten Island.""<br><br>He got a van, came<br>to Staten Island,<br><br>dug up a tree like<br>in the Greenbelt<br><br>or something where<br>there's a million trees.<br><br>And did you<br>put it in like a bucket<br><br>or did you...<br><br>No, I think they just<br>put a mound of dirt around it,<br><br>as I recall.<br><br>They didn't expect it to stay.<br><br>It was in the middle<br>of the street.<br><br>Like they just wanted<br>to like do something.<br><br>We went to Lincoln Center.<br><br>It might have been the<br>opening of Lincoln Center.<br><br>You know, those like<br>industrial boxes of Tide<br><br>like they have at a<br>laundromat so you can buy<br><br>like a cupful or whatever?<br><br>They dumped one of<br>those in the fountain.<br><br>And it just like started,<br>it was like a comedy movie.<br><br>It just like started foaming<br>up and all these people<br><br>who were like, you know...<br><br>uh...<br><br>society contributors<br>to Lincoln Center, right?<br><br>They were all done<br>up to the nines<br><br>and they were all like<br>slipping in the foam.<br><br>And it was great.<br>It was so beautiful.<br><br>There was a lot of<br>liberation movements<br><br>in the East Village<br>in those days.<br><br>They were all kind<br>of interesting, so...<br><br>But the Yippies were the<br>most ridiculous, you know,<br><br>so that appealed to me<br><br>and Charles Ludlam<br>was ridiculous<br><br>and that appealed to me.<br><br>Ridiculousness is something<br>that I've always kind of,<br><br>especially, if it's really<br>intelligent ridiculousness<br><br>it's kind of appealing to me.<br><br>We've really expanded<br>all definitions<br><br>and all mediums to where<br>that you have to forget<br><br>those definitions that you<br>learned in school.<br><br>But you got<br>to forget that, folks.<br><br>So, you got to forget<br>the definition of art,<br><br>the definition of music, the<br>definition of video art now.<br><br>All these things are being<br>expanded every single day.<br><br>Music does not aim<br>at sound itself,<br><br>but is in a complex conception.<br><br>First, forget about sounds.<br><br>Sounds must be free.<br><br>The goal of today's<br>Mansion of Fun show<br><br>is to live with<br>godlike composure<br><br>on the full rush of energy,<br>like Dionysus riding the leopard<br><br>without being torn to pieces.<br><br>Hey, Leroy!<br><br>- What?<br>- Your mama.<br><br>She's calling you, man.<br><br>You know, when I was a kid,<br>I lived on East Sixth Street.<br><br>Before that, I lived<br>on Third Street<br><br>on the Hells Angels block.<br><br>Not my cup of tea.<br><br>I mean, it was all right.<br><br>But... one day there was<br>a knock at the door,<br><br>which was in the kitchen,<br><br>which is also where the<br>bathtub was located.<br><br>I opened the door and<br>there stood this big viking<br><br>who was wearing a tutu<br>and paratrooper boots<br><br>and some like ripped<br>yellow tights.<br><br>Next to him was this<br>little Colombian guy.<br><br>He was kind of like cleaning<br>his nails with a stiletto.<br><br>But still I thought, ""I gotta<br>watch out for this big guy.""<br><br>Turned out though it<br>was the little guy<br><br>I had to watch out for.<br><br>Anyway, it was Arthur Kane<br>and Billy Murcia.<br><br>And... Thank you.<br><br>Arthur said to me, ""I<br>understand you're a singer.""<br><br>I didn't really<br>expect that voice,<br><br>you know, to come<br>out of this Cossack.<br><br>I said, ""Yeah, I like to sing.""<br><br>He said, ""Well, we're<br>trying to start a band<br><br>and we need a singer.""<br><br>And I said, ""OK, I'm in.""<br><br>I mean, you know, I made<br>snap decisions in those days.<br><br>You know, like later on in<br>life you start thinking,<br><br>""Well, what's this gonna<br>be like in six months?""<br><br>You know?<br><br>This is like,<br>at that point like,<br><br>""What's this going to be like""<br>let me do the arithmetics.<br><br>Fifty years later,<br>you're still like,<br><br>""Oh my God, what was that?""<br><br>So we went over to 10th Street<br><br>where Johnny Thunders had<br>a very nice apartment.<br><br>The bathtub was in the bathroom,<br>you know what I'm saying?<br><br>Couple other rooms.<br><br>I think his mother<br>was paying his rent.<br><br>I mean, I'm not sure, OK?<br><br>So don't quote me on that.<br><br>New York Dolls<br>guitarist Johnny Thunders<br><br>was found dead on the<br>floor of a guest house<br><br>in the French Quarter of New<br>Orleans on Tuesday afternoon.<br><br>The cause of death hasn't<br>yet been determined.<br><br>But Thunders, whose given<br>name was John Genzale,<br><br>had a longtime drug habit.<br><br>Our will is hard<br><br>Man, it's so hard<br><br>And it's a lonely<br>planet joy<br><br>When you bring a song<br>from your other boy<br><br>That's when I'm a<br>lonely planet boy<br><br>And I'm tryin'<br><br>For your love<br><br>Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah<br><br>You pick me up<br><br>You're out drivin'<br>in your car<br><br>I tell you where I'm going<br><br>You're always

soul<br><br>Of my heart<br><br>I don't wanna be<br><br>No artist<br><br>I'm a dancin', singin'<br><br>A work of art<br><br>Yeah, you lit my heart<br><br>With fiery aggression<br>and you showed me<br><br>This feeling of love<br><br>Of sex and affection<br>that ya owed me<br><br>Danger<br><br>And I ain't scared<br><br>In danger<br><br>I found the splendor there<br><br>I was dancin' on<br>a flamin' pit<br><br>Dancing<br><br>We are creating it<br><br>We're dancing<br><br>Right on the lip<br><br>Of a volcano<br><br>Nature with its true voice<br>cries out undissembled<br><br>Be as I

yeah!<br><br>Oh!<br><br>In the center of action of<br>my psyche's need for love<br><br>I want liberation and joy<br><br>In a paroxysm<br>of intoxication<br><br>Inspiration ain't<br>no way to be coy<br><br>In danger<br><br>A blazing glare<br><br>Oh, yes!<br><br>In danger<br><br>I found the splendor there<br><br>Oh, yeah<br><br>Dancin' atop flamin' pit<br><br>Dancin', we're creating it<br><br>We're dancin'<br>right on the lip<br><br>Of a volcano<br><br>Volcano<br><br>A volcano<br><br>Thrown in the dance<br>with the mystics<br><br>It's burnin' us<br>up with his music<br><br>It's sensualistic<br><br>It's ritual<br><br>It's polytheistic<br><br>Ye-heh-heh.<br><br>Whoa.<br><br>Oh, smokestack lightning<br><br>Shinin' just like gold<br><br>Oh, don't you<br>hear me cryin'<br><br>A-whoo-hoo<br><br>A-whoo-hoo<br><br>A-whoo-hoo<br><br>Oh, stop your tryin'<br><br>Let a poor boy ride<br><br>Oh, don't you<br>hear me cryin'<br><br>A-whoo-hoo<br><br>A-whoo-hoo<br><br>A-whoo-hoo<br><br>A lot of these are from<br>when I sang with Hubert.<br><br>A lot of Howlin' Wolf<br><br>Wang-Dang-Doodle and<br>things of that nature.<br><br>Oh, here's Blind Willie McTell<br>and his wife.<br><br>Apparently he shot his wife.<br>He only winged her.<br><br>But from what they say,<br>it may be apocryphal,<br><br>but they say that he stood<br>in the middle of the room<br><br>and just, like, swung<br>around rapid firing...<br><br>like a ballet dancer.<br><br>What's this one?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>This is...<br><br>It says it's Buster's<br>big book, so...<br><br>let's see.<br><br>Explain to<br>me your lyric book.<br><br>It's not just lyrics in there.<br><br>There's something else in there.<br><br>What's in that book that<br>I used for the show?<br><br>Uh-huh.<br><br>There's a lot of, like,<br>devotional art in there.<br><br>There's millions of<br>Hindu gods, you know.<br><br>You ever go to, like,<br>Central Park<br><br>and there'll be a lot of, like,<br>Cuban guys and Puerto-Ricans<br><br>and they're all playing<br>congas and things like that.<br><br>Do they still have that there?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>You know those guys that<br>are into, like, the Orishas?<br><br>So, like, say you<br>and me are playing.<br><br>'Cause you know, the rumbas<br>all have, you know, like...<br><br>saints that each beat is<br>dedicated to or whatever.<br><br>So they kind of just, like,<br><br>beam it up and then it<br>comes back down to you.<br><br>It's not like we're playing,<br>like, at each other.<br><br>So when<br>you'll turn a page,<br><br>there'll be a<br>different image there<br><br>that's associated<br>somehow with that song.<br><br>It could be associated<br>with that song.<br><br>It's just something that reminds<br>me of what I'm there for,<br><br>you know.<br><br>Because it makes it a lot<br>more fun for me, you know.<br><br>Music to me is, you know, they<br>say playing music, you know.<br><br>They don't say<br>like working music.<br><br>You're supposed to be playing.<br><br>So...<br><br>If I don't do it as some<br>kind of a devotional thing,<br><br>it's gonna become<br>a grind for me.<br><br>You're in the Mansion Of Fun<br><br>with Sri Rama,<br><br>Poindexter, Johansen.<br><br>Where...<br><br>aestheticism<br><br>and eroticism...<br><br>are two sides of the same coin.<br><br>And unwillingness to see<br>this exacts a terrible price<br><br>in prudery, misery<br><br>and warped lives.<br><br>I'm just a bad boy<br><br>La la la la la la<br>la la la la la la<br><br>La la la la la la<br>la la la la la<br><br>All dressed up<br>in fancy clothes<br><br>I'm taking the trouble<br><br>To blow my bubble<br><br>Away<br><br>Bad boy<br><br>La la la la la la<br>la la la la la la<br><br>La la la la la la<br>la la la la la<br><br>Life is just<br>a bowl of cherries<br><br>I'm taking the trouble<br><br>To turn my night into day<br><br>You, were in the vanguard<br>of punk, new wave,<br><br>with the New York Dolls.<br><br>Legendary group.<br><br>Now, what made you<br>completely abandon<br><br>that kind of rock and<br>roll that you were doing?<br><br>I understand in Cleveland<br>you just decided<br><br>that you had enough of it.<br><br>Well, I'll tell you.<br><br>Contrary to popular<br>belief, you know,<br><br>because the Dolls<br>were such, like,<br><br>a shock kind of<br>troop battalion that...<br><br>I think a lot of people<br>didn't realize that<br><br>the Dolls music was...<br><br>built like basically, you know,<br><br>the roots of the thing was<br>really rhythm and blues.<br><br>And it was, like, a<br>classic rock and roll band.<br><br>What makes a classic<br>rock and roll band?<br><br>Big Fat Mamas<br>Are Back In Style.<br><br>And... uh Lavender Coffin?<br><br>Lavender... All I want is a<br>lavender coffin<br><br>and what I call pre-haze cold<br>rock and roll.<br><br>How did Buster<br>Poindexter become?<br><br>Well, basically, after<br>the Dolls, you know<br><br>I did the David Johansen<br>show for many years.<br><br>I was on the road for<br>like 250 nights a year.<br><br>And I had a lot of fun.<br><br>But after a while, you know,<br>you want to come back home<br><br>you want to kind of<br>establish relationships<br><br>and things like that.<br><br>So I came up with<br>this brilliant idea<br><br>to come up with an act that<br>could only play in New York.<br><br>There was a club in my<br>neighborhood called Tramps<br><br>and I thought I was gonna<br>do four Mondays there<br><br>because, it was a Blues bar<br><br>but they didn't have<br>acts on Mondays.<br><br>And so I thought I'd do, well,<br>since there's nobody there<br><br>on Monday, I'd try this<br>little cabaret thing<br><br>with, like, three<br>guys as a backup band.<br><br>And I started doing it and<br><br>it caught on and all of a<br>sudden I was making my nut,<br><br>so to speak.<br><br>And I wasn't going on the road.<br><br>I wanted to do a show that<br>would entertain my peers,<br><br>so to speak.<br><br>Now your peers, you're<br>what, 36 now, about?<br><br>I'm 37.<br><br>- Thirty-seven now.<br>- For a few more minutes.<br><br>Really inching up there.<br><br>- ""Inching up there,"" to where?<br>- Well, I don't know.<br><br>- To the end.<br>- The next thing you'll be 40.<br><br>- This is the big one.<br>- Right.<br><br>OK, there's two<br>Yiddish hipsters.<br><br>It's a short joke.<br><br>Two Yiddish hipsters<br>sitting on a park bench<br><br>and one of them says<br><br>""Oy.""<br><br>And the other one says,<br>""I'm hip.""<br><br>OK?<br><br>Do you ever<br>write down, not jokes,<br><br>but, like, banter and<br>things you wanna say?<br><br>Banter?<br><br>Like things you wanna say<br>between songs that aren't jokes?<br><br>You mean that aren't funny?<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- No.<br><br>No.<br><br>I mean, you know, if I'm<br>playing in, like, a big place,<br><br>I'm not, like,<br>telling jokes because...<br><br>The David Johansen band<br>went on this whole tour<br><br>with Pat Benatar<br>and you know, she's great.<br><br>She can really belt out a tune.<br><br>But...<br><br>they would kinda look at me<br><br>like I was a bug a lot of the<br>times in those...<br><br>hockey rinks, you know?<br><br>Like you<br>were a little guy<br><br>or like you were a freak or...<br><br>Like a bug.<br><br>And what kind of<br>songs can Buster sing<br><br>that you can't sing?<br><br>Uh...<br><br>Everything.<br>I mean, you know,<br><br>I can sing, you know,<br>a lot of kinds of songs, but...<br><br>I think I already went<br>through this with you.<br><br>Like, Buster is just like,<br>I can do anything I want.<br><br>People aren't...<br><br>expecting something else.<br><br>They come because<br>it's unexpected,<br><br>what I'm gonna do, you know?<br><br>And they kind of trust<br>that it's gonna be good<br><br>and it's always good.<br>What can I say?<br><br>I woke up late one day<br><br>And turned on my TV<br><br>They said they'd<br>take it all<br><br>When I was asleep<br><br>Well they were<br>bringing down doors<br><br>They were purging<br>and burning<br><br>People just like me<br><br>Well I fixed a drink,<br>I switched around the channel<br><br>But that was<br>all I could see<br><br>Well it's such<br>a boring feeling<br><br>When you find that<br>you're fallin' to a<br><br>Totalitarian state<br><br>Well, I know what's left<br><br>It don't seem right<br><br>You just don't<br>feel so great<br><br>Well it seems<br>we're all camping<br><br>And the Mexicans<br>was laughing<br><br>Down at the<br>detention center<br><br>They didn't seem to care<br>that they were there<br><br>I couldn't find<br>one dissenter<br><br>I didn't feel communal<br><br>I was incommunicado<br><br>I couldn't see it<br>getting any better<br><br>I couldn't call no one<br><br>I wish I had a gun<br><br>I couldn't even<br>send a letter<br><br>It's such a boring feeling<br><br>When you find that<br>you're falling<br><br>To a totalitarian state<br><br>I know what's left<br><br>It don't seem right<br><br>You just don't<br>feel so great<br><br>When they came to get me<br><br>I'd hope they would<br>forgive me<br><br>I tried playing dead<br><br>I finished my drink,<br>assessed the situation<br><br>Put the covers<br>up over my head<br><br>I quit<br><br>Well, me and my friends<br><br>All hang out in a<br>non-litigious crowd<br><br>We're sensitive to<br>other people's needs<br><br>And on this we are proud<br><br>But this situation<br>really bites<br><br>I mean, for crying out loud<br><br>I don't know what to do<br><br>I feel like a fool<br><br>This time I'm gonna sue<br><br>It's such a boring feeling<br><br>When you find that<br>you're fallin' to a<br><br>Totalitarian state<br><br>You know what's left<br><br>It don't seem right<br><br>It just don't seem so great<br><br>Oh!<br><br>Whoa.<br>Whoa.<br><br>Hey, hey.<br><br>Hey, hey.<br><br>Totalitarian State...<br>Baby!<br><br>It sounds like<br>you've never really been bitter<br><br>about the fact that<br><br>the Dolls never garnered<br>these huge wages,<br><br>whereas you could<br>look at bands like<br><br>Kiss and Aerosmith<br><br>and they made a<br>pretty good dime off<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- essentially a<br><br>watered-down version<br>of what you were doing.<br><br>Yeah, no. We, we were<br>a band's band, you know?<br><br>In a lot of ways.<br><br>And we influenced<br>a lot of bands<br><br>and a lot of kids<br>were influenced by us<br><br>who started bands, you know.<br><br>Take the Ramones.<br><br>The Ramones saw us and they,<br><br>they looked at each<br>other and said,<br><br>""Hey, if these guys can<br>do that, we can do that.""<br><br>And to have influence<br>like that on people,<br><br>I think, is really good,<br>you know.<br><br>To give people the...<br><br>the idea like,<br><br>""Hey, I could do that.""<br><br>Wow, listen to<br>how sweet that is.<br><br>Didn't I make you feel<br><br>- Like you were the only man<br>- Whoo!<br><br>That's probably<br>Aretha playing piano.<br><br>- Didn't I give you everything<br>-You know that?<br><br>That a woman possibly can<br><br>- Is this her sister?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>But with all the<br>love I give ya<br><br>It's never enough<br><br>But I'm gonna show ya, baby<br><br>That a woman can be tough<br><br>Is there any<br>music you just don't like?<br><br>Most, most stuff on<br>the radio.<br><br>I don't even know<br>what I don't like,<br><br>because I just don't hear it.<br><br>You know?<br>It doesn't,<br><br>if I like something it stops in<br>the middle of my head<br><br>and it just rattles around<br><br>and if I don't like it it just<br>kind of goes through me and<br><br>I don't grab it.<br><br>You know, my show is not like<br><br>something that...<br><br>your average kid<br>would understand.<br><br>Why not?<br><br>Why not?<br><br>Because it's, it's<br>out of the ordinary,<br><br>you know, it's kind of like...<br><br>it's got, it's like peculiar<br>to my taste, you know.<br><br>That Marilyn Horne version,<br>she gets right to the meat.<br><br>Did the folks play that stuff?<br><br>- How'd you get turned on to...<br>- Oh, you know, my old man,<br><br>he was an opera singer.<br><br>And it's like, all that we heard<br><br>had been classical<br>music when I was a kid,<br><br>- Oh.<br>- which used to drive me crazy.<br><br>- Mm-hmm.<br>- My old man would be like<br><br>wearing his army clothes,<br>paint in the house<br><br>and the Texaco Opera<br>on the Grundig<br><br>would be in the window,<br>blaring out.<br><br>And my friends would come by,<br><br>on Saturday and I'd be like<br>holding the ladder<br><br>and I'd be like...<br><br>My old man would<br>be up there like<br><br>And now...<br><br>and now it's all<br>over your radio show.<br><br>This next song, I wrote it to<br><br>a Lightnin' Hopkins song.<br><br>Texas Blues.<br><br>I gave the lyrics to Brian,<br><br>see what he wanted<br>to do with it.<br><br>And he came up with<br>this really great song<br><br>and we're gonna<br>sing it for you now.<br><br>So the only one who sounds<br>like Lightnin' Hopkins<br><br>in this version is me.<br><br>I give you that Eddie<br>Murphy smile, like...<br><br>I keep watching<br>and wondering<br><br>Why a little bird<br>flies up to the sky<br><br>Only God knows,<br>maybe he don't<br><br>You know that holy<br>talk has been a lie<br><br>I keep praying<br>it's the truth<br><br>And I ain't got<br>no death to die<br><br>I ain't got no death to die<br><br>Yeah, I keep<br>hollering and prayin'<br><br>I don't have to be<br>such a hurtful bum<br><br>How could I<br>sometimes be so good<br><br>And turn around and<br>be so wrong to some<br><br>Ah, what's the use<br>of all this praying<br><br>When I don't know<br>the spirit from<br><br>The spirit from who<br>this prayer have come<br><br>That old eternal spirit<br><br>Always whispering in my ear<br><br>Radiance of the infinite<br><br>Seems to be everywhere<br><br>But my weary eyes can't see<br><br>And I'm afraid my<br>old ears cannot hear<br><br>Afraid my old<br>ears cannot hear<br><br>You've been a<br>consolation of my life<br><br>And you will be of my death<br><br>And I pray that<br>you'll have mercy<br><br>Moment of my last breath<br><br>I know these<br>words of weariness<br><br>Just don't make me wander<br>from death to death<br><br>Don't make me wander<br>from death to death<br><br>Beautiful.<br><br>Now, our next guest<br>is truly a unique rock star.<br><br>I mean he's what you call a<br>free spirit, a knockout singer,<br><br>starting a heat wave right<br>here at the Waldorf-Astoria<br><br>singing Hot Hot Hot,<br>Buster Poindexter!<br><br>One, two, three!<br><br>Ole-Ole-Ole-Ole<br><br>Ole-Ole-Ole-Ole<br><br>That was like, the bane of my<br>existence, that song, you know.<br><br>I don't know how I<br>feel about it now.<br><br>I haven't heard it lately.<br><br>Would<br>you hear it like<br><br>all over the place like...<br><br>Oh, God, that's<br>ubiquitous, that song.<br><br>It was like, forget about it.<br><br>It's like, you know,<br><br>they play it at weddings,<br>bar mitzvahs.

We've had some crises.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>As we get<br>older, we accumulate ghosts.<br><br>'Cause, you know,<br>there's a lot more dead people<br><br>than there are the living.<br><br>I've lived through<br>like, Vietnam War,<br><br>the AIDS epidemic...<br><br>and so many things, you know?<br><br>And had people who I love<br><br>that have died from COVID<br>very recently, you know.<br><br>Put

audition.<br><br>I mean, we got along<br>like a house on fire.<br><br>I mean, ""Oh God, David.<br>David, I love you.""<br><br>And we were drinking schnapps<br><br>and we were smacking<br>each other on of back<br><br>and we were having a<br>gay old time, OK?<br><br>Oh my God, it was so great.<br><br>So then he calls<br>Twyla Tharp and he says,<br><br>""I got, I got the guy.<br><br>This is the guy.<br>I'm gonna send him over.<br><br>You see if he can dance.""<br><br>In order to get this part,<br><br>the... one of the major parts<br>that you had to pass.<br><br>Milos, Twyla...<br><br>and Galt MacDermot,<br><br>who wrote the music.<br><br>So I went over to Twyla Tharp's.<br><br>I was...<br><br>dancing... like Nijinsky.<br><br>I mean, I was like...<br><br>like a gazelle.<br><br>Back and forth<br><br>with the whole troop back and<br>forth, like throwing flowers.<br><br>I mean imaginary flowers,<br>but still.<br><br>Twyla calls up Milos,<br><br>""He's, he's great.<br>He's a natural. He's great.""<br><br>I'm thinking, you know,<br>""Hollywood, here I come.""<br><br>I'm like picking<br>out real estate,<br><br>you know what I'm saying?<br><br>Next day I go to<br>see Galt McDermott.<br><br>It's up on one of those<br>Broadway rehearsal rooms,<br><br>you know, at the piano and<br>everybody's standing around.<br><br>He's got the piano<br>and I come in<br><br>and I decide to<br>sing the song Hair.<br><br>I figured, you know,<br><br>I hadn't really prepared.<br><br>You know and...<br>but Galt McDermott stood up.<br><br>He shut the... the...<br>the lid of the keyboard<br><br>and he said,<br>""This guy can't sing!""<br><br>I was like, ""Wait a<br>minute, wait a minute.<br><br>I don't, I don't act.<br><br>I don't dance, but I'm a singer.<br><br>You know, I, that's<br>what I do.

[Sky] Hey, what's all this?<br><br>- Fritzy's doing fine.<br><br>- Luckily.<br><br>Look what you've done.<br><br>- Mhm.<br><br>[glass tinkling]<br><br>- Marina, we need water.<br><br>[water splashing]<br><br>- You can do magic too?<br><br>- We can all do magic<br>since we were nine,<br><br>that's why were hoping it<br>would happen to you too.<br><br>Now there's four of us.<br><br>- I can float stuff<br>through the air.<br><br>- Flame, you're up next.<br><br>[flame crackling]<br><br>- Why didn't any of you<br>tell me you could do magic?<br><br>We could be big stars<br>on the internet.<br><br>- We don't have these powers<br>so that we can become famous.<br><br>- Then why do we have them then?<br><br>- Just gets dressed.<br>- Done that.<br><br>Today I'm wearing<br>my lucky pajamas.<br><br>- Are you kidding me?<br><br>There's no way you're going<br>to school in your pajamas.<br><br>We're singing today.<br><br>- Okay then, only the top?<br><br>- That sucked.<br>- Huh uh.<br><br>- Hurry up.<br><br>- Hang on.<br><br>First I want to know, how<br>is it that we can do magic?<br><br>- I don't know, but<br>now we can find out.<br><br>Come on, let's go.<br><br>- Where to?<br><br>- [Girls] To the basement.<br><br>- Sky.<br><br>Happy birthday, my sweetheart.<br><br>- Just guess what's happened?<br><br>I can, ow!<br><br>- What can you do?<br>- She can count backwards now.<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>- Yeah, very nice.<br><br>Now please come with me.<br><br>Oh no, wait, stop, I<br>forgot the candles.<br><br>- They don't know.<br><br>- And we don't say<br>anything either.<br><br>- But why not?<br><br>- When it first started with me,<br><br>I was so excited I told them.<br><br>Mom dropped the coffee can in<br>shock and Dad drove the car<br><br>out of the garage and<br>straight into a tree<br><br>because he was so upset and<br>wanted to take me to the doctor.<br><br>- You know the way they are,<br>loving but not really helpful.<br><br>- And did they take<br>you to the doctor?<br><br>- No, I told them real fast<br>that I had just made it up.<br><br>Everybody was relieved, and<br>we never spoke about it again.<br><br>That means not a word,<br>it's better that way.<br><br>- [Mom] You can all come now!<br><br>- And just act normal, okay?<br><br>- So guys, can we go?<br><br>I have something I have to do.<br><br>- But don't you<br>want your presents?<br><br>- Later this afternoon.<br><br>- But Sky, dear, we<br>haven't sung for you yet.<br><br>- Eh, at my age, that stuff<br>isn't necessary anymore.<br><br>- But we're singing<br>afterwards at school.<br><br>- Hey, is something going on?<br><br>- [Girls] No.<br><br>- What would be going on?<br><br>- It's just that it makes me<br>wonder why you wouldn't jump<br><br>at the chance to sing.<br><br>I thought you girls<br>loved to sing.<br><br>- Yeah, okay.<br><br>♪ Happy birthday to me<br><br>♪ Happy birthday to me<br><br>♪ Happy birthday, dear Sky<br><br>♪ Happy birthday to me<br><br>- But you can't sing happy<br>birthday to yourself.<br><br>- If it's my birthday,<br>then I'm allowed to sing.<br><br>- Then sing one of your songs.<br><br>How about my favorite song?<br><br>♪ If you're on the ground<br>in the pouring rain ♪<br><br>♪ We're there for each other<br><br>♪ When you go through flames<br>and stand in hurricanes ♪<br><br>♪ We're there for each other<br><br>♪ Because we're often alone,<br>too small on our own ♪<br><br>♪ Never let go of your dreams<br><br>♪ For together we are great<br><br>♪ We are great<br><br>- Uh, bye.<br><br>- But the song has<br>three more verses.<br><br>- [gasping] A secret passage?<br><br>- A secret room, but shh,<br>only we know about it.<br><br>And now you do too.<br><br>- [Sky] [laughing] Cool.<br><br>Wicked.<br><br>- Wait until you see this here.<br><br>- Wow.<br><br>- Now that Sky has her<br>magical abilities as well,<br><br>we'll finally unravel the<br>mystery of the wind rose.<br><br>- But the fact is that you<br>couldn't do anything without me.<br><br>- Without each other.<br><br>It takes eight hands.<br><br>- It takes eight hands<br>because if it's only me,<br><br>then what are you gonna do--<br><br>- Sky.<br><br>- Okay, okay.<br><br>- So now we put our hands<br>on those hand prints<br><br>and wait and see what happens.<br><br>[dramatic music]<br><br>[symbol rumbling]<br><br>- Wow.<br><br>[fountain booming]<br>[girls shouting]<br><br>[cup rattling]<br><br>[magic humming]<br><br>- The fountain has opened again.<br><br>Pixie dust hangs<br>in the atmosphere.<br><br>- What's that?<br><br>- Shut your mouth.<br><br>At last, I can fulfill<br>my father's dream<br><br>and take on the powers of<br>the elements to myself.<br><br>Then I'll be the most powerful<br>sorceress in the world.<br><br>I must get to the fountain.<br><br>I have to go to Cantrip Towers.<br><br>Oswald, call them<br>right up and tell them<br><br>that I want to buy the old box.<br><br>Make these Cantrips an offer<br>that they can't refuse.<br><br>And pack the suitcase.<br><br>[magic humming]<br>[teapot shattering]<br><br>Get going.<br><br>- Yes, my lady.<br><br>[dramatic music]<br><br>[magic humming]<br><br>- So now is the time, Baxter.<br><br>[Baxter grumbling]<br><br>The moths fly to the light.<br><br>Time to collect dust.<br><br>It's going to Cantrip Towers.<br><br>- Crazy.<br><br>- It looks so beautiful.<br><br>Just look how it lights up.<br><br>- Flora, we're all standing<br>right in front of it.<br><br>- Oh yeah, right.<br><br>And what do we do now?<br><br>[magic twinkling]<br><br>- Super cool.<br><br>[girls laughing]<br><br>- Do you feel that<br>tickling in your fingers?<br><br>- It almost feels like the<br>power is going through us.<br><br>[dramatic music]<br><br>- [Flora] Whoa!<br><br>- Wow, how crazy.<br><br>[Sky laughing]<br><br>- [Girls] Sky!<br><br>- I have super powers!<br><br>- The rose has<br>strengthened our powers.<br><br>- And now you, Flame.<br><br>[flame roaring]<br><br>- Whoa!<br>- Wow!<br><br>- Mega.<br><br>- Marina, do something.<br><br>[water splashing]<br><br>- Girls, girls, where are you?<br><br>You have to get going.<br><br>You have to get<br>to your auditions.<br><br>- Yeah, we're coming!<br>- Ah, good.<br><br>- This afternoon,<br>we'll meet here again.<br><br>But don't do magic until then.<br><br>Sky!<br><br>Especially not in public.<br><br>You know how dangerous that is.<br><br>- Yes.<br><br>[magic twinkling]<br><br>- Cheers!<br><br>- Bye.<br><br>All the best.<br>- Cheers, mama.<br><br>- Cheers.<br>- No thanks.<br><br>No, no, no, no.<br><br>- What's up with that colorful<br>cloud and why did it shine?<br><br>- Let's go.<br><br>We will solve this<br>puzzle together<br><br>but as inconspicuously<br>as possible.<br><br>- We don't want to<br>sell this house.<br><br>- I'm sorry, my lady,<br>the Cantrips don't want<br><br>to sell the house.<br><br>- What, what?<br><br>A small-town conductor<br>and a cellist?<br><br>That must be an incredible<br>amount of money for them.<br><br>- Maybe the Cantrips<br>like their house.<br><br>- Oh, did he say anything else?<br><br>- No, only so long as<br>the roof over their heads<br><br>doesn't collapse,<br>they're not selling.<br><br>- Hm, we'll see about that.<br><br>[violin music]<br><br>- Marina, super<br>outfit like always.<br><br>- Thank you.<br><br>- You've got to put<br>more work into it.<br><br>You can't perform like that<br>at the Royal Music Hall.<br><br>- Verena, we're not even<br>in the semifinals yet.<br><br>- But it's totally<br>obvious you'll make it.<br><br>Just listen to the competition.<br><br>[audience applauding]<br><br>You guys are up next.<br><br>- Thank you.<br><br>- That was Ricardo<br>Schmitz from Class 3A.<br><br>[audience applauding]<br><br>And now the Sista Magic.<br><br>[audience applauding]<br><br>- Stop, where are you going?<br><br>- I need my lucky top.<br><br>- Not now.<br><br>[magic twinkling]<br><br>Hey, are you kidding me?<br><br>Stop that right now.<br><br>I told you it's forbidden to...<br><br>[crowd gasping]<br><br>- [Quinn] Hey, is<br>everything okay?<br><br>- Hey.<br><br>- Hey.<br><br>- Hi.<br><br>- Hey.<br><br>- Hi.<br><br>- Is it my turn now?<br><br>Hey, it's okay, are you ready?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>What for?<br><br>- Well, to sing.<br><br>- Oh, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.<br><br>♪ I've got a tinging inside<br><br>♪ Tell me do you feel that too<br><br>♪ You think the<br>curtain's rising ♪<br><br>♪ And the

your fingers ♪<br><br>♪ And the whole<br>world flashes by ♪<br><br>♪ For every moment enchants me<br><br>[doorbell ringing]<br><br>- Hi, so let's go get started.<br><br>- What?<br><br>What are we starting?<br><br>- I see that you have no idea.<br><br>- Who are you?<br><br>- The name is Miss Duggery,<br><br>and I have very<br>important work to do.<br><br>- Oh, I get it,<br>you're the new help.<br><br>You'll have to excuse me,<br><br>but my husband didn't tell<br>me that he had found someone.<br><br>Hi, welcome.<br><br>- It's not my problem if you<br>two don't talk to each other.<br><br>- We do that, except...<br><br>Okay, I have to practice now,<br><br>and later I have my<br>orchestra rehearsal.<br><br>Will you be all<br>right on your own?<br><br>- I will be a lot<br>better off on my own.<br><br>- Very good.<br>- Yes.<br><br>- Till later.<br><br>[Baxter grumbles]<br>- Yes.<br><br>Okay, Sidney, on to<br>the elves dust source.<br><br>[Baxter mumbling excitedly]<br><br>Slowly, old man, slowly.<br><br>You don't want to choke.<br><br>[audience applauding]<br><br>- Thank you, Sista<br>Magic, that was super.<br><br>The jury will soon<br>announce their decision.<br><br>How does it look?<br><br>The decision please.<br><br>The Sista Magic<br>[audience applauding]<br><br>will represent our<br>school in the semifinal.<br><br>The five best acts are<br>going to the grand finale.<br><br>You guys will definitely be in.<br><br>- Hi.<br><br>Oh, sorry, I meant--<br><br>- You guys were super good.<br><br>You'll go to the<br>final, it's a sure bet.<br><br>- Miss Duggery,<br>what are you doing?<br><br>- Well, what's it<br>look like I'm doing?<br><br>- Dusting.<br><br>- Well, then that must<br>be what I'm doing.<br><br>- But outside?<br><br>- It doesn't make much<br>sense to dust inside.<br><br>If you stand there and watch,<br>then Baxter can't concentrate.<br><br>- I have to go now.<br><br>- Yeah, I'm not<br>stopping you, go, go.<br><br>- Cheers.<br><br>- So Baxter.<br>- Mhm.<br><br>- Our work is done and<br>the girls are up to bat.<br><br>[Baxter mumbling]<br>Really, all used?<br><br>[Baxter mumbling]<br><br>But the house is locked.<br><br>[Baxter mumbling]<br><br>What are you talking about?<br><br>I can't do magic.<br><br>No, there is no more elf<br>dust today, stop complaining.<br><br>[door buzzing]<br><br>[door buzzing]<br><br>- Pixie dust.<br><br>Everything's covered<br>in pixie dust.<br><br>- Eureka, just what<br>my lady wanted.<br><br>- Moron, somebody put<br>a protective shield<br>over the house.<br><br>I need fresh pixie dust.<br><br>- Don't get excited, my lady.<br><br>You know what'll<br>happen if you do.<br><br>[Glenda retching]<br>[toad croaking]<br><br>- Oswald, do something.<br><br>- Think about something<br>beautiful, something<br>that makes you<br><br>happy and puts you<br>in a good mood again.<br><br>[Glenda retching]<br>[toad croaking]<br><br>What if you think about<br>small, sweet kittens?<br><br>- I hate cats, you know that.<br><br>[Glenda retching]<br>[toad croaking]<br><br>- Then think of<br>barbecued kittens.<br><br>- What was it this<br>Cantrip said again?<br><br>As long as the roof doesn't<br>fall in over their heads,<br><br>they won't sell.<br><br>Oh yeah, that's a possibility.<br><br>[bird squawking]<br><br>[roof rumbling]<br><br>Now let's go before<br>anybody sees us.<br><br>[bird squawking]<br><br>- My lady, once you've<br>acquired Cantrip Towers,<br><br>does that then mean<br>our deal is done?<br><br>- Three years, my dear,<br>three years was the deal,<br><br>and it's only been two<br>years and nine months.<br><br>- Yes, but--<br>- Yes, but they should have<br><br>thought about it before they<br>laughed about my disability.<br><br>- But toads hop<br>out of your mouth<br><br>when you're upset<br>and get hiccups.<br><br>That is definitely<br>funny [laughing].<br><br>- No, it's definitely not funny.<br><br>[magic buzzing]<br><br>[hog oinking]<br><br>[horn honking]<br><br>[magic buzzing]<br><br>- If in the end you can't<br>do magic when you are<br><br>stricken with hiccups,<br>then it's a disability,<br><br>and one doesn't laugh at that,<br>even if your magical powers<br><br>exceed your disability<br>by a wide margin.<br><br>- Exactly.<br><br>And now call up Cantrip<br>Towers and offer twice as much<br><br>as the house is worth.<br><br>[phone ringing]<br><br>- Collin Cantrip.<br><br>[phone ringing]<br><br>- Collin.<br><br>- Thanks.<br><br>Collin Cantrip.<br><br>- We are going to<br>double our offer.<br><br>- Excuse me?<br><br>- [Oswald] For Cantrip Towers.<br><br>- I've already told you<br>this isn't about money.<br><br>- But I implore you,<br>it's always about money.<br><br>You should take the time to--<br><br>- Excuse me.<br><br>I'll call you back.<br><br>- Hello, hello?<br><br>He hung up on me.<br><br>- How can something<br>like this happen?<br><br>- Yeah, it's an old roof.<br><br>I should've renewed<br>it a long time ago.<br><br>- But there's a whole<br>other reason for it.<br><br>Maybe it has something<br>to do with the rose.<br><br>It vibrated so much.<br><br>- I don't know how on earth<br>we're supposed to pay for this.<br><br>The house is already<br>swallowing so much money.<br><br>This man that wants<br>to buy the house,<br><br>he's just called about it again.<br><br>He doubled the offer.<br><br>- Can I do something?<br><br>If we all give up<br>our allowances maybe?<br><br>- Thanks, my sweet, but that<br>really wouldn't be enough.<br><br>- Who the heck is that?<br><br>- Hm?<br>- Hm?<br><br>- Who?<br>- I don't see anyone.<br><br>- Let's go inside,<br>we have to talk.<br><br>- We've received an<br>offer for the house.<br><br>Someone wants to<br>buy Cantrip Towers,<br><br>and they have offered twice<br>as much as it's worth.<br><br>- Up to now, we've<br>rejected such offers.<br><br>But now all of you<br>have to decide.<br><br>- How come we?<br><br>- Because the house<br>belongs to all of you.<br><br>It's your inheritance.<br><br>- What now?<br><br>Flame, Marina, Flora, and<br>me, we own Cantrip Towers?<br><br>- How is that?<br><br>- Sidney Cantrip, your<br>great grandfather,<br><br>put it right in the will.<br><br>- If four sisters are<br>born into a family,<br><br>the house goes to the four<br>sisters after the fourth child<br><br>has her ninth birthday.<br><br>- In any case, you have to<br>decide whether the house<br><br>is to be sold or not.<br><br>Nobody's offered so<br>much money up to now.<br><br>- And where would we live then?<br><br>- The big city, that<br>has so many advantages.<br><br>- How can you even<br>think of that?<br><br>- What about it?<br><br>I did not say we<br>should sell the house.<br><br>- This is not up for debate.<br><br>We're not selling.<br><br>- Hey, can we at<br>least talk about it?<br><br>You can't decide<br>about everything.<br><br>- Use your brains, this<br>is a special house.<br><br>- So no matter how you<br>choose, we will support you.<br><br>- Think it over carefully<br>and then take a vote.<br><br>- And do it anonymously.<br><br>The majority wins.<br><br>- Whoever wants to sell<br>lays a marble in the bowl.<br><br>- It's every man for himself<br>when no one else is around.<br><br>If and when three marbles are<br>in the bowl the house is sold.<br><br>Uh, maybe we better<br>use something else.<br><br>No, marbles.<br><br>So--<br>- Thank you.<br><br>- [Mom] You're welcome.<br><br>- Who did it?<br><br>Who put the marble in the bowl?<br><br>- Well, so much for<br>it being anonymous.<br><br>- So you were the one.<br><br>- Nope, maybe, what does<br>it matter who it was?<br><br>- Yeah, exactly.<br><br>- So it was you.<br><br>Should've occurred to me.<br><br>- And if it was, what are<br>you gonna do about it?<br><br>- Flame, stop with<br>all the drama now.<br><br>- Just stop, it was me.<br><br>- [Flame] You, how come?<br><br>- Because I don't<br>want Mom and Dad<br><br>having to worry about money.<br><br>- This is a very special house.<br><br>Come, let's go to the rose.<br><br>[dramatic music]<br><br>- Where are you<br>going now, Oswald?<br><br>Is this the way to<br>my five-star hotel?<br><br>- Ah, well, about the hotel--<br><br>- What, what, what?<br><br>- It's booked up.<br><br>All the hotels in the<br>neighborhood were booked.<br><br>There was only one accommodation<br>that had a free room<br><br>somewhat out of the way.<br><br>- How many stars?<br><br>- None.<br>[Glenda groaning]<br><br>It is a small, privately<br>owned bed and breakfast<br><br>in the forest.<br><br>My apologies, my lady.<br><br>That's it.<br><br>- I think you have to<br>be joking, that is--<br><br>[stomach gurgling]<br><br>- Don't get excited,<br>don't get upset.<br><br>[Glenda retching]<br>[toad croaking]<br><br>[Glenda retching]<br>[toad croaking]<br><br>- Limping hamsters,<br>whimpering pups.<br><br>Darn it, what did you suggest?<br><br>- Barbecued kittens.<br><br>[Glenda retching]<br><br>- Barbecued kittens,<br>barbecued kittens.<br><br>This has to be<br>some kind of joke.<br><br>- Does that mean<br>we're driving on?<br><br>- Yes, of course.<br><br>No, wait, the view is a lot<br>better than I first thought.<br><br>Gather up the creatures.<br><br>I can use them to<br>buy Cantrip Towers.<br><br>- Where am I<br>supposed to put them?<br><br>I say, that's my suitcase.<br><br>- Of course it is.<br><br>You think I'd use mine?<br><br>[toads croaking]<br><br>- Okay, just think about<br>what's been going on.<br><br>Our roof collapses.<br><br>A strange woman sneaks<br>around the garden.<br><br>Someone offers way too<br>much money for our house.<br><br>This is no coincidence.<br><br>It's all got something<br>to do with this rose.<br><br>- Careful.<br><br>[magic humming]<br><br>- [gasping] There's<br>something on here.<br><br>Elements.<br><br>- There are more leaves inside,<br><br>and there's something<br>on this too.<br><br>- Cool, a puzzle.<br><br>Conquer the world<br>together, cool.<br><br>- Responsibility<br>of the elements.<br><br>The responsibility of the world.<br><br>- Be heedful of the elements.<br><br>- We'll take the one with the<br>conquering the world thing.<br><br>- No, all the words<br>must be accommodated,<br><br>and the colors have to match.<br><br>Four elements.<br><br>- [Sky] Together rule.<br><br>- The world.<br><br>- Be aware of the<br>responsibility.<br><br>- Four elements<br>together rule the world.<br><br>Be aware of the responsibility.<br><br>- That sounds creepy.<br>- Mhm.<br><br>- We're not allowed to do<br>more magic until we find out<br><br>what's going on with the house.<br><br>- I think that we should<br>use our magical powers<br><br>to repair the roof.<br><br>- Yeah, then we<br>don't have to sell.<br><br>Mom and Dad have rehearsal<br>the whole day tomorrow.<br><br>- Tomorrow we'll go first<br>to the city archive.<br><br>There we can find accounting<br>records of Cantrip Towers.<br><br>- We can do both tomorrow.<br><br>First repair the roof,<br>then go to the city.<br><br>- And how do you explain the<br>repaired roof to Mom and Dad?<br><br>- I would just talk a<br>lot of nonsense to them.<br><br>After a few minutes of that,<br><br>they're so exhausted that<br>they stop asking questions.<br><br>- Okay.<br>- Yes!<br><br>[dramatic music]<br><br>[Baxter grumbles]<br><br>- I know, I don't like<br>this Glenda either, bleh.<br><br>I just knew she would pop up,<br><br>and so I booked every<br>free hotel room in town.<br><br>[Baxter laughing]<br><br>I need to know what she's up to.<br><br>- Hello, anyone there?<br><br>- Yes.<br><br>- Yes, so what about breakfast?<br><br>- No, thank you, I already ate.<br><br>- I booked a room with<br>breakfast included.<br><br>On the sign in<br>front of your house,<br><br>it says bed and breakfast.<br><br>- Tea, my lady?<br><br>- Oswald, where have I ended up?<br><br>Does that old thing work?<br><br>- Not by itself.<br><br>You have to look through it.<br><br>- The point of my<br>question being whether<br><br>one is allowed to use it or not.<br><br>- Well, then you can always ask.<br><br>- Can I use this looking glass?<br><br>- Sure, you don't have to ask.<br><br>[Glenda retching]<br>[toad croaking]<br><br>No pets allowed in the house.<br><br>- Cheers, Dad.<br><br>- And you're sure that<br>you want to take the bus?<br><br>- Yes.<br>- Yeah, bye Dad, bye Mom.<br><br>- Cheers, Mama.<br>- Cheers.<br><br>- Ciao.<br><br>-

here?<br><br>To help answer that question,<br>we have an expert opinion<br>from Dr. Conover Brown.<br><br>With the film history<br>department at UCLA.<br><br>Dr. Brown, what can you<br>tell us about this,<br>media phenomenon?<br><br>Technically, it is not<br>a so-called ""snuff film,""<br>because as I understand it,<br><br>the woman in question,<br>is planning to commit suicide.<br><br>However, my concern is that<br>she is being wilfully assisted<br>by her ""co-star"",<br><br>and by her ""director""<br>of this alleged ""movie.""<br><br>Whatever this is,<br>even if it turns out to be<br>a joke,<br><br>it is,<br>definitely appalling.<br><br>If it's the woman<br>who wants to die,<br>then why is it her ""co-star""<br><br>that's being hanged?<br><br>He is apparently<br>an escaped mental

there was blood,<br>or a weapon,<br>or something.<br><br>[startled]<br><br>Stop scaring me.<br><br>-How is the woman doing?<br>-OK.<br>I think you should go<br><br>say hi to Candy.<br>I think she would like that.<br><br>-This way.<br>-Let's go get some food,<br>I am hungry.<br><br>-Hi.<br>-Hi, what's wrong?<br><br>My mom spanked me,<br>because I didn't want<br>to go to bed.<br><br>Come
